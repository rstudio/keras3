# keras3: R Interface to 'Keras'

Interface to 'Keras' <https://keras.io>, a high-level neural networks
API. 'Keras' was developed with a focus on enabling fast
experimentation, supports both convolution based networks and recurrent
networks (as well as combinations of the two), and runs seamlessly on
both CPU and GPU devices.

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, developed with a focus on
enabling fast experimentation. Keras has the following key features:

## Details

- Allows the same code to run on CPU or on GPU, seamlessly.

- User-friendly API which makes it easy to quickly prototype deep
  learning models.

- Built-in support for convolutional networks (for computer vision),
  recurrent networks (for sequence processing), and any combination of
  both.

- Supports arbitrary network architectures: multi-input or multi-output
  models, layer sharing, model sharing, etc. This means that Keras is
  appropriate for building essentially any deep learning model, from a
  memory network to a neural Turing machine.

- Is capable of running on top of multiple back-ends including
  [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow),
  [Jax](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax), or
  [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).
