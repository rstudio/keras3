close to 0 and the output standard deviation close to 1.
Importantly, batch normalization works differently during training and
during inference.
During training (i.e. when using fit() or when calling the layer/model
with the argument training = TRUE), the layer normalizes its output using
the mean and standard deviation of the current batch of inputs. That is to
say, for each channel being normalized, the layer returns
gamma * (batch - mean(batch)) / sqrt(var(batch) + epsilon) + beta, where:
epsilon is small constant (configurable as part of the constructor
arguments)
gamma is a learned scaling factor (initialized as 1), which
can be disabled by passing scale = FALSE to the constructor.
beta is a learned offset factor (initialized as 0), which
can be disabled by passing center = FALSE to the constructor.


During inference (i.e. when using evaluate() or predict() or when
calling the layer/model with the argument training = FALSE (which is the
default), the layer normalizes its output using a moving average of the
mean and standard deviation of the batches it has seen during training. That
is to say, it returns
gamma * (batch - self$moving_mean) / sqrt(self$moving_var+epsilon) + beta.
self$moving_mean and self$moving_var are non-trainable variables that
are updated each time the layer in called in training mode, as such:
moving_mean = moving_mean * momentum + mean(batch) * (1 - momentum)
moving_var = moving_var * momentum + var(batch) * (1 - momentum)


As such, the layer will only normalize its inputs during inference
after having been trained on data that has similar statistics as the
inference data.
About setting layer$trainable &amp;lt;- FALSE on a BatchNormalization layer:
The meaning of setting layer$trainable &amp;lt;- FALSE is to freeze the layer,
i.e. its internal state will not change during training:
its trainable weights will not be updated
during fit() or train_on_batch(), and its state updates will not be run.
Usually, this does not necessarily mean that the layer is run in inference
mode (which is normally controlled by the training argument that can
be passed when calling a layer). &quot;Frozen state&quot; and &quot;inference mode&quot;
are two separate concepts.
However, in the case of the BatchNormalization layer, setting
trainable &amp;lt;- FALSE on the layer means that the layer will be
subsequently run in inference mode (meaning that it will use
the moving mean and the moving variance to normalize the current batch,
rather than using the mean and variance of the current batch).
Note that:
Setting trainable on an model containing other layers will recursively
set the trainable value of all inner layers.
If the value of the trainable attribute is changed after calling
compile() on a model, the new value doesn't take effect for this model
until compile() is called again.
