Description: Interface to 'Keras' <https://keras.io>, a high-level neural
  networks 'API'. 'Keras' was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation,
  supports both convolution based networks and recurrent networks (as well as
  combinations of the two), and runs seamlessly on both 'CPU' and 'GPU' devices.
