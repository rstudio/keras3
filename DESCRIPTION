Description: Interface to 'Keras', a high-level neural networks API which 
  runs on top of TensorFlow. 'Keras' was developed with a focus on enabling
  fast experimentation, supports both convolutional networks and recurrent
  networks (as well as combinations of the two), and seamlessly on both CPUs
  and GPUs.
