Description: Interface to 'Keras', a high-level neural networks API which 
  runs on top of 'TensorFlow'. 'Keras' was developed with a focus on enabling
  fast experimentation, supports both convolution based networks and recurrent
  networks (as well as combinations of the two), and runs seamlessly on both 
  'CPU' and 'GPU' devices.
