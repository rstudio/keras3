Help on class Nadam in module keras.src.optimizers.nadam:

class Nadam(keras.src.optimizers.optimizer.Optimizer)
 |  Nadam(learning_rate=0.001, beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.999, epsilon=1e-07, weight_decay=None, clipnorm=None, clipvalue=None, global_clipnorm=None, use_ema=False, ema_momentum=0.99, ema_overwrite_frequency=None, loss_scale_factor=None, gradient_accumulation_steps=None, name='nadam', **kwargs)
 |
 |  Optimizer that implements the Nadam algorithm.
 |
 |  Much like Adam is essentially RMSprop with momentum, Nadam is Adam with
 |  Nesterov momentum.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      learning_rate: A float, a
 |          `keras.optimizers.schedules.LearningRateSchedule` instance, or
 |          a callable that takes no arguments and returns the actual value to
 |          use. The learning rate. Defaults to `0.001`.
 |      beta_1: A float value or a constant float tensor, or a callable
 |          that takes no arguments and returns the actual value to use. The
 |          exponential decay rate for the 1st moment estimates.
 |          Defaults to `0.9`.
 |      beta_2: A float value or a constant float tensor, or a callable
 |          that takes no arguments and returns the actual value to use. The
 |          exponential decay rate for the 2nd moment estimates. Defaults to
 |          `0.999`.
 |      epsilon: A small constant for numerical stability. This epsilon is
 |          "epsilon hat" in the Kingma and Ba paper (in the formula just before
 |          Section 2.1), not the epsilon in Algorithm 1 of the paper.
 |          Defaults to `1e-7`.
 |      name: String. The name to use
 |          for momentum accumulator weights created by
 |          the optimizer.
 |      weight_decay: Float. If set, weight decay is applied.
 |      clipnorm: Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is individually
 |          clipped so that its norm is no higher than this value.
 |      clipvalue: Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is clipped to be
 |          no higher than this value.
 |      global_clipnorm: Float. If set, the gradient of all weights is clipped
 |          so that their global norm is no higher than this value.
 |      use_ema: Boolean, defaults to `False`.
 |          If `True`, exponential moving average
 |          (EMA) is applied. EMA consists of computing an exponential moving
 |          average of the weights of the model (as the weight values change
 |          after each training batch), and periodically overwriting the
 |          weights with their moving average.
 |      ema_momentum: Float, defaults to 0.99. Only used if `use_ema=True`.
 |          This is the momentum to use when computing
 |          the EMA of the model's weights:
 |          `new_average = ema_momentum * old_average + (1 - ema_momentum) *
 |          current_variable_value`.
 |      ema_overwrite_frequency: Int or None, defaults to None. Only used if
 |          `use_ema=True`. Every `ema_overwrite_frequency` steps of iterations,
 |          we overwrite the model variable by its moving average.
 |          If None, the optimizer
 |          does not overwrite model variables in the middle of training,
 |          and you need to explicitly overwrite the variables
 |          at the end of training by calling
 |          `optimizer.finalize_variable_values()` (which updates the model
 |          variables in-place). When using the built-in `fit()` training loop,
 |          this happens automatically after the last epoch,
 |          and you don't need to do anything.
 |      loss_scale_factor: Float or `None`. If a float, the scale factor will
 |          be multiplied the loss before computing gradients, and the inverse
 |          of the scale factor will be multiplied by the gradients before
 |          updating variables. Useful for preventing underflow during
 |          mixed precision training. Alternately,
 |          `keras.optimizers.LossScaleOptimizer` will
 |          automatically set a loss scale factor.
 |      gradient_accumulation_steps: Int or `None`. If an int, model & optimizer
 |          variables will not be updated at every step; instead they will be
 |          updated every `gradient_accumulation_steps` steps, using the average
 |          value of the gradients since the last update. This is known as
 |          "gradient accumulation". This can be useful
 |          when your batch size is very small, in order to reduce gradient
 |          noise at each update step.

 |
 |  get_config(self)
 |      Returns the config of the optimizer.
 |
 |      An optimizer config is a Python dictionary (serializable)
 |      containing the configuration of an optimizer.
 |      The same optimizer can be reinstantiated later
 |      (without any saved state) from this configuration.
 |
 |      Subclass optimizer should override this method to include other
 |      hyperparameters.
