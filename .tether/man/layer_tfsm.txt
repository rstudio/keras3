Help on class TFSMLayer in module keras.src.export.export_lib:

class TFSMLayer(keras.src.layers.layer.Layer)
 |  TFSMLayer(filepath, call_endpoint='serve', call_training_endpoint=None, trainable=True, name=None, dtype=None)
 |
 |  Reload a Keras model/layer that was saved via SavedModel / ExportArchive.
 |
 |  Arguments:
 |      filepath: `str` or `pathlib.Path` object. The path to the SavedModel.
 |      call_endpoint: Name of the endpoint to use as the `call()` method
 |          of the reloaded layer. If the SavedModel was created
 |          via `model.export()`,
 |          then the default endpoint name is `'serve'`. In other cases
 |          it may be named `'serving_default'`.
 |
 |  Example:
 |
 |  ```python
 |  model.export("path/to/artifact")
 |  reloaded_layer = TFSMLayer("path/to/artifact")
 |  outputs = reloaded_layer(inputs)
 |  ```
 |
 |  The reloaded object can be used like a regular Keras layer, and supports
 |  training/fine-tuning of its trainable weights. Note that the reloaded
 |  object retains none of the internal structure or custom methods of the
 |  original object -- it's a brand new layer created around the saved
 |  function.
 |
 |  **Limitations:**
 |
 |  * Only call endpoints with a single `inputs` tensor argument
 |  (which may optionally be a dict/tuple/list of tensors) are supported.
 |  For endpoints with multiple separate input tensor arguments, consider
 |  subclassing `TFSMLayer` and implementing a `call()` method with a
 |  custom signature.
 |  * If you need training-time behavior to differ from inference-time behavior
 |  (i.e. if you need the reloaded object to support a `training=True` argument
 |  in `__call__()`), make sure that the training-time call function is
 |  saved as a standalone endpoint in the artifact, and provide its name
 |  to the `TFSMLayer` via the `call_training_endpoint` argument.

 |
 |      An object config is a Python dictionary (serializable)
 |      containing the information needed to re-instantiate it.
