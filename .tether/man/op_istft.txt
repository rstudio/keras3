__doc__
Inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform along the last axis of the input.

To reconstruct an original waveform, the parameters should be the same in
`stft`.

Args:
    x: Tuple of the real and imaginary parts of the input tensor. Both
        tensors in the tuple should be of floating type.
    sequence_length: An integer representing the sequence length.
    sequence_stride: An integer representing the sequence hop size.
    fft_length: An integer representing the size of the FFT that produced
        `stft`. Should be of type `int32`.
    length: An integer representing the output is clipped to exactly length.
        If not specified, no padding or clipping take place. Defaults to
        `None`.
    window: A string, a tensor of the window or `None`. If `window` is a
        string, available values are `"hann"` and `"hamming"`. If `window`
        is a tensor, it will be used directly as the window and its length
        must be `sequence_length`. If `window` is `None`, no windowing is
        used. Defaults to `"hann"`.
    center: Whether `x` was padded on both sides so that the t-th sequence
        is centered at time `t * sequence_stride`. Defaults to `True`.

Returns:
    A tensor containing the inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform along the
    last axis of `x`.

Example:

>>> x = keras.ops.convert_to_tensor([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
>>> istft(stft(x, 1, 1, 1), 1, 1, 1)
array([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
