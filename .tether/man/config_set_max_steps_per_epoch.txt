keras.config.set_max_steps_per_epoch(max_steps_per_epoch)
__doc__
Limit the maximum number of steps for any call to fit/evaluate/predict.

This will cap the number of steps for single epoch of a call to `fit()`,
`evaluate()`, or `predict()`. This is purely for debugging, and can also be
set via the `KERAS_MAX_STEPS_PER_EPOCH` environment variable to quickly run
a scrip without modifying its source.

Args:
    max_epochs: The integer limit on the number of epochs or `None`. If
        `None`, no limit is applied.
