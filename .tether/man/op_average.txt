__doc__
Compute the weighted average along the specified axis.

Args:
    x: Input tensor.
    axis: Integer along which to average `x`. The default, `axis=None`,
        will average over all of the elements of the input tensor. If axis
        is negative it counts from the last to the first axis.
    weights: Tensor of weights associated with the values in `x`. Each
        value in `x` contributes to the average according to its
        associated weight. The weights array can either be 1-D (in which
        case its length must be the size of a along the given axis) or of
        the same shape as `x`. If `weights=None` (default), then all data
        in `x` are assumed to have a weight equal to one.

        The 1-D calculation is: `avg = sum(a * weights) / sum(weights)`.
        The only constraint on weights is that `sum(weights)` must not be 0.

Returns:
    Return the average along the specified axis.

Examples:
>>> data = keras.ops.arange(1, 5)
>>> data
array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=int32)
>>> keras.ops.average(data)
array(2.5, dtype=float32)
>>> keras.ops.average(
...     keras.ops.arange(1, 11),
...     weights=keras.ops.arange(10, 0, -1)
... )
array(4., dtype=float32)

>>> data = keras.ops.arange(6).reshape((3, 2))
>>> data
array([[0, 1],
       [2, 3],
       [4, 5]], dtype=int32)
>>> keras.ops.average(
...     data,
...     axis=1,
...     weights=keras.ops.array([1./4, 3./4])
... )
array([0.75, 2.75, 4.75], dtype=float32)
>>> keras.ops.average(
...     data,
...     weights=keras.ops.array([1./4, 3./4])
... )
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
ValueError: Axis must be specified when shapes of a and weights differ.
