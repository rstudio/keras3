Used to instantiate a Keras tensor.

A Keras tensor is a symbolic tensor-like object, which we augment with
certain attributes that allow us to build a Keras model just by knowing the
inputs and outputs of the model.

For instance, if `a`, `b` and `c` are Keras tensors,
it becomes possible to do:
`model = Model(input=[a, b], output=c)`

Args:
    shape: A shape tuple (tuple of integers or `None` objects),
        not including the batch size.
        For instance, `shape=(32,)` indicates that the expected input
        will be batches of 32-dimensional vectors. Elements of this tuple
        can be `None`; `None` elements represent dimensions where the shape
        is not known and may vary (e.g. sequence length).
    batch_size: Optional static batch size (integer).
    dtype: The data type expected by the input, as a string
        (e.g. `"float32"`, `"int32"`...)
    sparse: A boolean specifying whether the expected input will be sparse
        tensors. Note that, if `sparse` is `False`, sparse tensors can still
        be passed into the input - they will be densified with a default
        value of 0. This feature is only supported with the TensorFlow
        backend. Defaults to `False`.
    batch_shape: Optional shape tuple (tuple of integers or `None` objects),
        including the batch size.
    name: Optional name string for the layer.
        Should be unique in a model (do not reuse the same name twice).
        It will be autogenerated if it isn't provided.
    tensor: Optional existing tensor to wrap into the `Input` layer.
        If set, the layer will use this tensor rather
        than creating a new placeholder tensor.
    optional: Boolean, whether the input is optional or not.
        An optional input can accept `None` values.

Returns:
  A Keras tensor.

Example:

```python
# This is a logistic regression in Keras
x = Input(shape=(32,))
y = Dense(16, activation='softmax')(x)
model = Model(x, y)
```
