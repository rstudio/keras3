Help on class RandomRotation in module keras.src.layers.preprocessing.random_rotation:

class RandomRotation(keras.src.layers.preprocessing.tf_data_layer.TFDataLayer)
 |  RandomRotation(factor, fill_mode='reflect', interpolation='bilinear', seed=None, fill_value=0.0, value_range=(0, 255), data_format=None, **kwargs)
 |
 |  A preprocessing layer which randomly rotates images during training.
 |
 |  This layer will apply random rotations to each image, filling empty space
 |  according to `fill_mode`.
 |
 |  By default, random rotations are only applied during training.
 |  At inference time, the layer does nothing. If you need to apply random
 |  rotations at inference time, pass `training=True` when calling the layer.
 |
 |  Input pixel values can be of any range (e.g. `[0., 1.)` or `[0, 255]`) and
 |  of integer or floating point dtype.
 |  By default, the layer will output floats.
 |
 |  **Note:** This layer is safe to use inside a `tf.data` pipeline
 |  (independently of which backend you're using).
 |
 |  Input shape:
 |      3D (unbatched) or 4D (batched) tensor with shape:
 |      `(..., height, width, channels)`, in `"channels_last"` format
 |
 |  Output shape:
 |      3D (unbatched) or 4D (batched) tensor with shape:
 |      `(..., height, width, channels)`, in `"channels_last"` format
 |
 |  Args:
 |      factor: a float represented as fraction of 2 Pi, or a tuple of size 2
 |          representing lower and upper bound for rotating clockwise and
 |          counter-clockwise. A positive values means rotating
 |          counter clock-wise,
 |          while a negative value means clock-wise.
 |          When represented as a single
 |          float, this value is used for both the upper and lower bound.
 |          For instance, `factor=(-0.2, 0.3)`
 |          results in an output rotation by a random
 |          amount in the range `[-20% * 2pi, 30% * 2pi]`.
 |          `factor=0.2` results in an
 |          output rotating by a random amount
 |          in the range `[-20% * 2pi, 20% * 2pi]`.
 |      fill_mode: Points outside the boundaries of the input are filled
 |          according to the given mode
 |          (one of `{"constant", "reflect", "wrap", "nearest"}`).
 |          - *reflect*: `(d c b a | a b c d | d c b a)`
 |              The input is extended by reflecting about
 |              the edge of the last pixel.
 |          - *constant*: `(k k k k | a b c d | k k k k)`
 |              The input is extended by
 |              filling all values beyond the edge with
 |              the same constant value k = 0.
 |          - *wrap*: `(a b c d | a b c d | a b c d)` The input is extended by
 |              wrapping around to the opposite edge.
 |          - *nearest*: `(a a a a | a b c d | d d d d)`
 |              The input is extended by the nearest pixel.
 |      interpolation: Interpolation mode. Supported values: `"nearest"`,
 |          `"bilinear"`.
 |      seed: Integer. Used to create a random seed.
 |      fill_value: a float represents the value to be filled outside
 |          the boundaries when `fill_mode="constant"`.
