Help on class SpatialDropout1D in module keras.src.layers.regularization.spatial_dropout:

class SpatialDropout1D(BaseSpatialDropout)
 |  SpatialDropout1D(rate, seed=None, name=None, dtype=None)
 |
 |  Spatial 1D version of Dropout.
 |
 |  This layer performs the same function as Dropout, however, it drops
 |  entire 1D feature maps instead of individual elements. If adjacent frames
 |  within feature maps are strongly correlated (as is normally the case in
 |  early convolution layers) then regular dropout will not regularize the
 |  activations and will otherwise just result in an effective learning rate
 |  decrease. In this case, `SpatialDropout1D` will help promote independence
 |  between feature maps and should be used instead.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      rate: Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the input units to drop.
 |
 |  Call arguments:
 |      inputs: A 3D tensor.
 |      training: Python boolean indicating whether the layer
 |          should behave in training mode (applying dropout)
 |          or in inference mode (pass-through).
 |
 |  Input shape:
 |      3D tensor with shape: `(samples, timesteps, channels)`
 |
 |  Output shape: Same as input.
