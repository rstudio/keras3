Help on class EarlyStopping in module keras.src.callbacks.early_stopping:

class EarlyStopping(keras.src.callbacks.callback.Callback)
 |  EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', min_delta=0, patience=0, verbose=0, mode='auto', baseline=None, restore_best_weights=False, start_from_epoch=0)
 |
 |  Stop training when a monitored metric has stopped improving.
 |
 |  Assuming the goal of a training is to minimize the loss. With this, the
 |  metric to be monitored would be `'loss'`, and mode would be `'min'`. A
 |  `model.fit()` training loop will check at end of every epoch whether
 |  the loss is no longer decreasing, considering the `min_delta` and
 |  `patience` if applicable. Once it's found no longer decreasing,
 |  `model.stop_training` is marked True and the training terminates.
 |
 |  The quantity to be monitored needs to be available in `logs` dict.
 |  To make it so, pass the loss or metrics at `model.compile()`.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      monitor: Quantity to be monitored. Defaults to `"val_loss"`.
 |      min_delta: Minimum change in the monitored quantity to qualify as an
 |          improvement, i.e. an absolute change of less than min_delta, will
 |          count as no improvement. Defaults to `0`.
 |      patience: Number of epochs with no improvement after which training will
 |          be stopped. Defaults to `0`.
 |      verbose: Verbosity mode, 0 or 1. Mode 0 is silent, and mode 1 displays
 |          messages when the callback takes an action. Defaults to `0`.
 |      mode: One of `{"auto", "min", "max"}`. In `min` mode, training will stop
 |          when the quantity monitored has stopped decreasing; in `"max"` mode
 |          it will stop when the quantity monitored has stopped increasing; in
 |          `"auto"` mode, the direction is automatically inferred from the name
 |          of the monitored quantity. Defaults to `"auto"`.
 |      baseline: Baseline value for the monitored quantity. If not `None`,
 |          training will stop if the model doesn't show improvement over the
 |          baseline. Defaults to `None`.
 |      restore_best_weights: Whether to restore model weights from the epoch
 |          with the best value of the monitored quantity. If `False`, the model
 |          weights obtained at the last step of training are used. An epoch
 |          will be restored regardless of the performance relative to the
 |          `baseline`. If no epoch improves on `baseline`, training will run
 |          for `patience` epochs and restore weights from the best epoch in
 |          that set. Defaults to `False`.
 |      start_from_epoch: Number of epochs to wait before starting to monitor
 |          improvement. This allows for a warm-up period in which no
 |          improvement is expected and thus training will not be stopped.
 |          Defaults to `0`.
 |
 |  Example:
 |
 |  >>> callback = keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='loss',
 |  ...                                               patience=3)
 |  >>> # This callback will stop the training when there is no improvement in
 |  >>> # the loss for three consecutive epochs.
 |  >>> model = keras.models.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10)])
 |  >>> model.compile(keras.optimizers.SGD(), loss='mse')
 |  >>> history = model.fit(np.arange(100).reshape(5, 20), np.zeros(5),
 |  ...                     epochs=10, batch_size=1, callbacks=[callback],
 |  ...                     verbose=0)
 |  >>> len(history.history['loss'])  # Only 4 epochs are run.

 |
 |  get_monitor_value(self, logs)
 |
 |  on_epoch_end(
 |    self,
 |    epoch,
 |    logs=None
 |  )
 |      Called at the end of an epoch.
 |
 |      Subclasses should override for any actions to run. This function should
 |      only be called during TRAIN mode.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          epoch: Integer, index of epoch.
 |          logs: Dict, metric results for this training epoch, and for the
 |            validation epoch if validation is performed. Validation result
 |            keys are prefixed with `val_`. For training epoch, the values of
 |            the `Model`'s metrics are returned. Example:
 |            `{'loss': 0.2, 'accuracy': 0.7}`.
 |
 |  on_train_begin(self, logs=None)
 |      Called at the beginning of training.
 |
 |      Subclasses should override for any actions to run.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          logs: Dict. Currently no data is passed to this argument for this
 |            method but that may change in the future.
 |
 |  on_train_end(self, logs=None)
 |      Called at the end of training.
 |
 |      Subclasses should override for any actions to run.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          logs: Dict. Currently the output of the last call to
 |            `on_epoch_end()` is passed to this argument for this method but
 |            that may change in the future.
