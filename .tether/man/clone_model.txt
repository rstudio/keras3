__doc__
Clone a Functional or Sequential `Model` instance.

Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

Note that
`clone_model` will not preserve the uniqueness of shared objects within the
model (e.g. a single variable attached to two distinct layers will be
restored as two separate variables).

Args:
    model: Instance of `Model`
        (could be a Functional model or a Sequential model).
    input_tensors: optional list of input tensors or InputLayer objects
        to build the model upon. If not provided,
        new `Input` objects will be created.
    clone_function: Callable with signature `fn(layer)`
        to be used to clone each layer in the target
        model (except `Input` instances). It takes as argument the
        layer instance to be cloned, and returns the corresponding layer
        instance to be used in the model copy. If unspecified, this callable
        defaults to the following serialization/deserialization function:
        `lambda layer: layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())`.
        By passing a custom callable, you can customize your copy of the
        model, e.g. by wrapping certain layers of interest (you might want
        to replace all `LSTM` instances with equivalent
        `Bidirectional(LSTM(...))` instances, for example).
        Defaults to `None`.
    call_function: Callable with signature
        `fn(layer, *args, **kwargs)` to be used to call each
        cloned layer and a set of inputs. It takes the layer instance,
        the call arguments and keyword arguments, and returns the
        call outputs. If unspecified, this callable defaults to
        the regular `__call__()` method:
        `def fn(layer, *args, **kwargs): return layer(*args, **kwargs)`.
        By passing a custom callable, you can insert new layers before or
        after a given layer. Note: this argument can only be used with
        Functional models.
    recursive: Boolean. Whether to recursively clone any Sequential
        or Functional models encountered in the original
        Sequential/Functional model. If `False`,
        then inner models are cloned by calling `clone_function()`.
        If `True`, then inner models are cloned by calling `clone_model()`
        with the same `clone_function`, `call_function`, and `recursive`
        arguments. Note that in this case, `call_function`
        will not be propagated to any Sequential model
        (since it is not applicable to Sequential models).

Returns:
    An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
    of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
    using newly instantiated weights. The cloned model may behave
    differently from the original model if a custom `clone_function`
    or `call_function` modifies a layer or layer call.

Example:

```python
# Create a test Sequential model.
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(728,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'),
])
# Create a copy of the test model (with freshly initialized weights).
new_model = clone_model(model)
```

Using a `clone_function` to make a model deterministic by setting the
random seed everywhere:

```python
def clone_function(layer):
    config = layer.get_config()
    if "seed" in config:
        config["seed"] = 1337
    return layer.__class__.from_config(config)

new_model = clone_model(model, clone_function=clone_function)
```

Using a `call_function` to add a `Dropout` layer after each `Dense` layer
(without recreating new layers):

```python
def call_function(layer, *args, **kwargs):
    out = layer(*args, **kwargs)
    if isinstance(layer, keras.layers.Dense):
        out = keras.layers.Dropout(0.5)(out)
    return out

new_model = clone_model(
    model,
    clone_function=lambda x: x,  # Reuse the same layers.
    call_function=call_function,
)
```

Note that subclassed models cannot be cloned by default,
since their internal layer structure is not known.
To achieve equivalent functionality
as `clone_model` in the case of a subclassed model, simply make sure
that the model class implements `get_config()`
(and optionally `from_config()`), and call:

```python
new_model = model.__class__.from_config(model.get_config())
```

In the case of a subclassed model, you cannot using a custom
`clone_function`.
