Help on class Dropout in module keras.src.layers.regularization.dropout:

class Dropout(keras.src.layers.layer.Layer)
 |  Dropout(rate, noise_shape=None, seed=None, **kwargs)
 |
 |  Applies dropout to the input.
 |
 |  The `Dropout` layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of
 |  `rate` at each step during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.
 |  Inputs not set to 0 are scaled up by `1 / (1 - rate)` such that the sum over
 |  all inputs is unchanged.
 |
 |  Note that the `Dropout` layer only applies when `training` is set to `True`
 |  in `call()`, such that no values are dropped during inference.
 |  When using `model.fit`, `training` will be appropriately set to `True`
 |  automatically. In other contexts, you can set the argument explicitly
 |  to `True` when calling the layer.
 |
 |  (This is in contrast to setting `trainable=False` for a `Dropout` layer.
 |  `trainable` does not affect the layer's behavior, as `Dropout` does
 |  not have any variables/weights that can be frozen during training.)
 |
 |  Args:
 |      rate: Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the input units to drop.
 |      noise_shape: 1D integer tensor representing the shape of the
 |          binary dropout mask that will be multiplied with the input.
 |          For instance, if your inputs have shape
 |          `(batch_size, timesteps, features)` and
 |          you want the dropout mask to be the same for all timesteps,
 |          you can use `noise_shape=(batch_size, 1, features)`.
 |      seed: A Python integer to use as random seed.
 |
 |  Call arguments:
 |      inputs: Input tensor (of any rank).
 |      training: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in
 |          training mode (adding dropout) or in inference mode (doing nothing).
