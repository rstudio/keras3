Help on class Hashing in module keras.src.layers.preprocessing.hashing:

class Hashing(keras.src.layers.layer.Layer)
 |  Hashing(num_bins, mask_value=None, salt=None, output_mode='int', sparse=False, **kwargs)
 |
 |  A preprocessing layer which hashes and bins categorical features.
 |
 |  This layer transforms categorical inputs to hashed output. It element-wise
 |  converts a ints or strings to ints in a fixed range. The stable hash
 |  function uses `tensorflow::ops::Fingerprint` to produce the same output
 |  consistently across all platforms.
 |
 |  This layer uses [FarmHash64](https://github.com/google/farmhash) by default,
 |  which provides a consistent hashed output across different platforms and is
 |  stable across invocations, regardless of device and context, by mixing the
 |  input bits thoroughly.
 |
 |  If you want to obfuscate the hashed output, you can also pass a random
 |  `salt` argument in the constructor. In that case, the layer will use the
 |  [SipHash64](https://github.com/google/highwayhash) hash function, with
 |  the `salt` value serving as additional input to the hash function.
 |
 |  **Note:** This layer internally uses TensorFlow. It cannot
 |  be used as part of the compiled computation graph of a model with
 |  any backend other than TensorFlow.
 |  It can however be used with any backend when running eagerly.
 |  It can also always be used as part of an input preprocessing pipeline
 |  with any backend (outside the model itself), which is how we recommend
 |  to use this layer.
 |
 |  **Note:** This layer is safe to use inside a `tf.data` pipeline
 |  (independently of which backend you're using).
 |
 |  **Example (FarmHash64)**
 |
 |  >>> layer = keras.layers.Hashing(num_bins=3)
 |  >>> inp = [['A'], ['B'], ['C'], ['D'], ['E']]
 |  >>> layer(inp)
 |  array([[1],
 |          [0],
 |          [1],
 |          [1],
 |          [2]])>
 |
 |  **Example (FarmHash64) with a mask value**
 |
 |  >>> layer = keras.layers.Hashing(num_bins=3, mask_value='')
 |  >>> inp = [['A'], ['B'], [''], ['C'], ['D']]
 |  >>> layer(inp)
 |  array([[1],
 |          [1],
 |          [0],
 |          [2],
 |          [2]])
 |
 |  **Example (SipHash64)**
 |
 |  >>> layer = keras.layers.Hashing(num_bins=3, salt=[133, 137])
 |  >>> inp = [['A'], ['B'], ['C'], ['D'], ['E']]
 |  >>> layer(inp)
 |  array([[1],
 |          [2],
 |          [1],
 |          [0],
 |          [2]])
 |
 |  **Example (Siphash64 with a single integer, same as `salt=[133, 133]`)**
 |
 |  >>> layer = keras.layers.Hashing(num_bins=3, salt=133)
 |  >>> inp = [['A'], ['B'], ['C'], ['D'], ['E']]
 |  >>> layer(inp)
 |  array([[0],
 |          [0],
 |          [2],
 |          [1],
 |          [0]])
 |
 |  Args:
 |      num_bins: Number of hash bins. Note that this includes the `mask_value`
 |          bin, so the effective number of bins is `(num_bins - 1)`
 |          if `mask_value` is set.
 |      mask_value: A value that represents masked inputs, which are mapped to
 |          index 0. `None` means no mask term will be added and the
 |          hashing will start at index 0. Defaults to `None`.
 |      salt: A single unsigned integer or None.
 |          If passed, the hash function used will be SipHash64,
 |          with these values used as an additional input
 |          (known as a "salt" in cryptography).
 |          These should be non-zero. If `None`, uses the FarmHash64 hash
 |          function. It also supports tuple/list of 2 unsigned
 |          integer numbers, see reference paper for details.
 |          Defaults to `None`.
 |      output_mode: Specification for the output of the layer. Values can be
 |          `"int"`, `"one_hot"`, `"multi_hot"`, or
 |          `"count"` configuring the layer as follows:
 |          - `"int"`: Return the integer bin indices directly.
 |          - `"one_hot"`: Encodes each individual element in the input into an
 |              array the same size as `num_bins`, containing a 1
 |              at the input's bin index. If the last dimension is size 1,
 |              will encode on that dimension.
 |              If the last dimension is not size 1, will append a new
 |              dimension for the encoded output.
 |          - `"multi_hot"`: Encodes each sample in the input into a
 |              single array the same size as `num_bins`,
 |              containing a 1 for each bin index
 |              index present in the sample. Treats the last dimension
 |              as the sample dimension, if input shape is
 |              `(..., sample_length)`, output shape will be
 |              `(..., num_tokens)`.
 |          - `"count"`: As `"multi_hot"`, but the int array contains a count of
 |              the number of times the bin index appeared in the sample.
 |          Defaults to `"int"`.
 |      sparse: Boolean. Only applicable to `"one_hot"`, `"multi_hot"`,
 |          and `"count"` output modes. Only supported with TensorFlow
 |          backend. If `True`, returns a `SparseTensor` instead of
 |          a dense `Tensor`. Defaults to `False`.
 |      **kwargs: Keyword arguments to construct a layer.
 |
 |  Input shape:
 |      A single string, a list of strings, or an `int32` or `int64` tensor
 |      of shape `(batch_size, ...,)`.
 |
 |  Output shape:
 |      An `int32` tensor of shape `(batch_size, ...)`.
