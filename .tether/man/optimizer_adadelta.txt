Help on class Adadelta in module keras.src.optimizers.adadelta:

class Adadelta(keras.src.optimizers.optimizer.Optimizer)
 |  Adadelta(learning_rate=0.001, rho=0.95, epsilon=1e-07, weight_decay=None, clipnorm=None, clipvalue=None, global_clipnorm=None, use_ema=False, ema_momentum=0.99, ema_overwrite_frequency=None, name='adadelta', **kwargs)
 |
 |  Optimizer that implements the Adadelta algorithm.
 |
 |  Adadelta optimization is a stochastic gradient descent method that is based
 |  on adaptive learning rate per dimension to address two drawbacks:
 |
 |  - The continual decay of learning rates throughout training.
 |  - The need for a manually selected global learning rate.
 |
 |  Adadelta is a more robust extension of Adagrad that adapts learning rates
 |  based on a moving window of gradient updates, instead of accumulating all
 |  past gradients. This way, Adadelta continues learning even when many updates
 |  have been done. Compared to Adagrad, in the original version of Adadelta you
 |  don't have to set an initial learning rate. In this version, the initial
 |  learning rate can be set, as in most other Keras optimizers.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      learning_rate: A float, a
 |          `keras.optimizers.schedules.LearningRateSchedule` instance, or
 |          a callable that takes no arguments and returns the actual value to
 |          use. The learning rate. Defaults to `0.001`. Note that `Adadelta`
 |          tends to benefit from higher initial learning rate values compared
 |          to other optimizers. To match the exact form in the original paper,
 |          use 1.0.
 |      rho: A floating point value. The decay rate. Defaults to `0.95`.
 |      epsilon: Small floating point value for maintaining numerical stability.
 |      name: String. The name to use
 |          for momentum accumulator weights created by
 |          the optimizer.
 |      weight_decay: Float. If set, weight decay is applied.
 |      clipnorm: Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is individually
 |          clipped so that its norm is no higher than this value.
 |      clipvalue: Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is clipped to be
 |          no higher than this value.
 |      global_clipnorm: Float. If set, the gradient of all weights is clipped
 |          so that their global norm is no higher than this value.
 |      use_ema: Boolean, defaults to False. If True, exponential moving average
 |          (EMA) is applied. EMA consists of computing an exponential moving
 |          average of the weights of the model (as the weight values change
 |          after each training batch), and periodically overwriting the
 |          weights with their moving average.
 |      ema_momentum: Float, defaults to 0.99. Only used if `use_ema=True`.
 |          This is the momentum to use when computing
 |          the EMA of the model's weights:
 |          `new_average = ema_momentum * old_average + (1 - ema_momentum) *
 |          current_variable_value`.
 |      ema_overwrite_frequency: Int or None, defaults to None. Only used if
 |          `use_ema=True`. Every `ema_overwrite_frequency` steps of iterations,
 |          we overwrite the model variable by its moving average.
 |          If None, the optimizer
 |          does not overwrite model variables in the middle of training,
 |          and you need to explicitly overwrite the variables
 |          at the end of training by calling
 |          `optimizer.finalize_variable_values()` (which updates the model
 |          variables in-place). When using the built-in `fit()` training loop,
 |          this happens automatically after the last epoch,
 |          and you don't need to do anything.
 |      loss_scale_factor: Float or `None`. If a float, the scale factor will
 |          be multiplied the loss before computing gradients, and the inverse
 |          of the scale factor will be multiplied by the gradients before
 |          updating variables. Useful for preventing underflow during
 |          mixed precision training. Alternately,
 |          `keras.optimizers.LossScaleOptimizer` will
 |          automatically set a loss scale factor.
 |      gradient_accumulation_steps: Int or `None`. If an int, model & optimizer
 |          variables will not be updated at every step; instead they will be
 |          updated every `gradient_accumulation_steps` steps, using the average
 |          value of the gradients since the last update. This is known as
 |          "gradient accumulation". This can be useful
 |          when your batch size is very small, in order to reduce gradient
 |          noise at each update step.
