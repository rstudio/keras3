Optionally loads weights pre-trained on ImageNet.
Note that the data format convention used by the model is
the one specified in your Keras config at `~/.keras/keras.json`.

Note: each Keras Application expects a specific kind of input preprocessing.
For DenseNet, call `keras.applications.densenet.preprocess_input`
on your inputs before passing them to the model.

Args:
    include_top: whether to include the fully-connected
    layer at the top of the network.
    weights: one of `None` (random initialization),
    `"imagenet"` (pre-training on ImageNet),
    or the path to the weights file to be loaded.
    input_tensor: optional Keras tensor
    (i.e. output of `layers.Input()`)
    to use as image input for the model.
    input_shape: optional shape tuple, only to be specified
    if `include_top` is False (otherwise the input shape
    has to be `(224, 224, 3)` (with `'channels_last'` data format)
    or `(3, 224, 224)` (with `'channels_first'` data format).
    It should have exactly 3 inputs channels,
    and width and height should be no smaller than 32.
    E.g. `(200, 200, 3)` would be one valid value.
    pooling: Optional pooling mode for feature extraction
    when `include_top` is `False`.
    - `None` means that the output of the model will be
        the 4D tensor output of the
        last convolutional block.
    - `avg` means that global average pooling
        will be applied to the output of the
        last convolutional block, and thus
        the output of the model will be a 2D tensor.
    - `max` means that global max pooling will
        be applied.
    classes: optional number of classes to classify images
    into, only to be specified if `include_top` is `True`, and
    if no `weights` argument is specified.
    classifier_activation: A `str` or callable.
    The activation function to use
    on the "top" layer. Ignored unless `include_top=True`. Set
    `classifier_activation=None` to return the logits
    of the "top" layer. When loading pretrained weights,
    `classifier_activation` can only be `None` or `"softmax"`.

Returns:
    A Keras model instance.
