keras.saving.register_keras_serializable(package='Custom', name=None)
__doc__
Registers an object with the Keras serialization framework.

This decorator injects the decorated class or function into the Keras custom
object dictionary, so that it can be serialized and deserialized without
needing an entry in the user-provided custom object dict. It also injects a
function that Keras will call to get the object's serializable string key.

Note that to be serialized and deserialized, classes must implement the
`get_config()` method. Functions do not have this requirement.

The object will be registered under the key `'package>name'` where `name`,
defaults to the object name if not passed.

Example:

```python
# Note that `'my_package'` is used as the `package` argument here, and since
# the `name` argument is not provided, `'MyDense'` is used as the `name`.
@register_keras_serializable('my_package')
class MyDense(keras.layers.Dense):
    pass

assert get_registered_object('my_package>MyDense') == MyDense
assert get_registered_name(MyDense) == 'my_package>MyDense'
```

Args:
    package: The package that this class belongs to. This is used for the
        `key` (which is `"package>name"`) to idenfify the class. Note that
        this is the first argument passed into the decorator.
    name: The name to serialize this class under in this package. If not
        provided or `None`, the class' name will be used (note that this is
        the case when the decorator is used with only one argument, which
        becomes the `package`).

Returns:
    A decorator that registers the decorated class with the passed names.
