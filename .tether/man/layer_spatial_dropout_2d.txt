Help on class SpatialDropout2D in module keras.src.layers.regularization.spatial_dropout:

class SpatialDropout2D(BaseSpatialDropout)
 |  SpatialDropout2D(rate, data_format=None, seed=None, name=None, dtype=None)
 |
 |  Spatial 2D version of Dropout.
 |
 |  This version performs the same function as Dropout, however, it drops
 |  entire 2D feature maps instead of individual elements. If adjacent pixels
 |  within feature maps are strongly correlated (as is normally the case in
 |  early convolution layers) then regular dropout will not regularize the
 |  activations and will otherwise just result in an effective learning rate
 |  decrease. In this case, `SpatialDropout2D` will help promote independence
 |  between feature maps and should be used instead.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      rate: Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the input units to drop.
 |      data_format: `"channels_first"` or `"channels_last"`.
 |          In `"channels_first"` mode, the channels dimension (the depth)
 |          is at index 1, in `"channels_last"` mode is it at index 3.
 |          It defaults to the `image_data_format` value found in your
 |          Keras config file at `~/.keras/keras.json`.
 |          If you never set it, then it will be `"channels_last"`.
 |
 |  Call arguments:
 |      inputs: A 4D tensor.
 |      training: Python boolean indicating whether the layer
 |          should behave in training mode (applying dropout)
 |          or in inference mode (pass-through).
 |
 |  Input shape:
 |      4D tensor with shape: `(samples, channels, rows, cols)` if
 |          data_format='channels_first'
 |      or 4D tensor with shape: `(samples, rows, cols, channels)` if
 |          data_format='channels_last'.
 |
 |  Output shape: Same as input.
