Help on class BinaryIoU in module keras.src.metrics.iou_metrics:

class BinaryIoU(IoU)
 |  BinaryIoU(target_class_ids=(0, 1), threshold=0.5, name=None, dtype=None)
 |
 |  Computes the Intersection-Over-Union metric for class 0 and/or 1.
 |
 |  Formula:
 |
 |  ```python
 |  iou = true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives + false_negatives)
 |  ```
 |  Intersection-Over-Union is a common evaluation metric for semantic image
 |  segmentation.
 |
 |  To compute IoUs, the predictions are accumulated in a confusion matrix,
 |  weighted by `sample_weight` and the metric is then calculated from it.
 |
 |  If `sample_weight` is `None`, weights default to 1.
 |  Use `sample_weight` of 0 to mask values.
 |
 |  This class can be used to compute IoUs for a binary classification task
 |  where the predictions are provided as logits. First a `threshold` is applied
 |  to the predicted values such that those that are below the `threshold` are
 |  converted to class 0 and those that are above the `threshold` are converted
 |  to class 1.
 |
 |  IoUs for classes 0 and 1 are then computed, the mean of IoUs for the classes
 |  that are specified by `target_class_ids` is returned.
 |
 |  Note: with `threshold=0`, this metric has the same behavior as `IoU`.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      target_class_ids: A tuple or list of target class ids for which the
 |          metric is returned. Options are `[0]`, `[1]`, or `[0, 1]`. With
 |          `[0]` (or `[1]`), the IoU metric for class 0 (or class 1,
 |          respectively) is returned. With `[0, 1]`, the mean of IoUs for the
 |          two classes is returned.
 |      threshold: A threshold that applies to the prediction logits to convert
 |          them to either predicted class 0 if the logit is below `threshold`
 |          or predicted class 1 if the logit is above `threshold`.
 |      name: (Optional) string name of the metric instance.
 |      dtype: (Optional) data type of the metric result.
 |
 |  Example:
 |
 |  >>> m = keras.metrics.BinaryIoU(target_class_ids=[0, 1], threshold=0.3)
 |  >>> m.update_state([0, 1, 0, 1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.7])
 |  >>> m.result()
 |  0.33333334
 |
 |  >>> m.reset_state()
 |  >>> m.update_state([0, 1, 0, 1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.7],
 |  ...                sample_weight=[0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1])
 |  >>> # cm = [[0.2, 0.4],
 |  >>> #        [0.3, 0.1]]
 |  >>> # sum_row = [0.6, 0.4], sum_col = [0.5, 0.5],
 |  >>> # true_positives = [0.2, 0.1]
 |  >>> # iou = [0.222, 0.125]
 |  >>> m.result()
 |  0.17361112
 |
 |  Usage with `compile()` API:
 |
 |  ```python
 |  model.compile(
 |      optimizer='sgd',
 |      loss='mse',
 |      metrics=[keras.metrics.BinaryIoU(
 |          target_class_ids=[0],
 |          threshold=0.5
 |      )]
 |  )
 |  ```

 |  Methods defined here:
 |
 |  __init__(
 |    self,
 |    target_class_ids=(0, 1),
 |    threshold=0.5,
 |    name=None,
 |    dtype=None
 |  )
 |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |
 |  get_config(self)
 |      Return the serializable config of the metric.
 |
 |  update_state(
 |    self,
 |    y_true,
 |    y_pred,
 |    sample_weight=None
 |  )
 |      Accumulates the confusion matrix statistics.
 |
 |      Before the confusion matrix is updated, the predicted values are
 |      thresholded to be:
 |          0 for values that are smaller than the `threshold`
 |          1 for values that are larger or equal to the `threshold`
 |
 |      Args:
 |          y_true: The ground truth values.
 |          y_pred: The predicted values.
 |          sample_weight: Optional weighting of each example. Can
 |              be a `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same as `y_true`,
 |              and must be broadcastable to `y_true`. Defaults to `1`.
 |
 |      Returns:
 |          Update op.
