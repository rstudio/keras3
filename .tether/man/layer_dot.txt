Help on class Dot in module keras.src.layers.merging.dot:

class Dot(keras.src.layers.merging.base_merge.Merge)
 |  Dot(axes, normalize=False, **kwargs)
 |
 |  Computes element-wise dot product of two tensors.
 |
 |  It takes a list of inputs of size 2, and the axes
 |  corresponding to each input along with the dot product
 |  is to be performed.
 |
 |  Let's say `x` and `y` are the two input tensors with shapes
 |  `(2, 3, 5)` and `(2, 10, 3)`. The batch dimension should be
 |  of same size for both the inputs, and `axes` should correspond
 |  to the dimensions that have the same size in the corresponding
 |  inputs. e.g. with `axes=(1, 2)`, the dot product of `x`, and `y`
 |  will result in a tensor with shape `(2, 5, 10)`
 |
 |  Examples:
 |
 |  >>> x = np.arange(10).reshape(1, 5, 2)
 |  >>> y = np.arange(10, 20).reshape(1, 2, 5)
 |  >>> keras.layers.Dot(axes=(1, 2))([x, y])
 |
 |  Usage in a Keras model:
 |
 |  >>> x1 = keras.layers.Dense(8)(np.arange(10).reshape(5, 2))
 |  >>> x2 = keras.layers.Dense(8)(np.arange(10, 20).reshape(5, 2))
 |  >>> y = keras.layers.Dot(axes=1)([x1, x2])
 |
 |  Args:
 |      axes: Integer or tuple of integers, axis or axes along which to
 |          take the dot product. If a tuple, should be two integers
 |          corresponding to the desired axis from the first input and the
 |          desired axis from the second input, respectively. Note that the
 |          size of the two selected axes must match.
 |      normalize: Whether to L2-normalize samples along the dot product axis
 |          before taking the dot product. If set to `True`, then
 |          the output of the dot product is the cosine proximity
 |          between the two samples.
 |      **kwargs: Standard layer keyword arguments.
 |
 |  Returns:
 |      A tensor, the dot product of the samples from the inputs.
