Help on class Lion in module keras.src.optimizers.lion:

class Lion(keras.src.optimizers.optimizer.Optimizer)
 |  Lion(learning_rate=0.001, beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.99, weight_decay=None, clipnorm=None, clipvalue=None, global_clipnorm=None, use_ema=False, ema_momentum=0.99, ema_overwrite_frequency=None, name='lion', **kwargs)
 |
 |  Optimizer that implements the Lion algorithm.
 |
 |  The Lion optimizer is a stochastic-gradient-descent method that uses the
 |  sign operator to control the magnitude of the update, unlike other adaptive
 |  optimizers such as Adam that rely on second-order moments. This make
 |  Lion more memory-efficient as it only keeps track of the momentum. According
 |  to the authors (see reference), its performance gain over Adam grows with
 |  the batch size. Because the update of Lion is produced through the sign
 |  operation, resulting in a larger norm, a suitable learning rate for Lion is
 |  typically 3-10x smaller than that for AdamW. The weight decay for Lion
 |  should be in turn 3-10x larger than that for AdamW to maintain a
 |  similar strength (lr * wd).
 |
 |  Args:
 |      learning_rate: A float, a
 |          `keras.optimizers.schedules.LearningRateSchedule` instance, or
 |          a callable that takes no arguments and returns the actual value to
 |          use. The learning rate. Defaults to `0.001`.
 |      beta_1: A float value or a constant float tensor, or a callable
 |          that takes no arguments and returns the actual value to use. The
 |          rate to combine the current gradient and the 1st moment estimate.
 |          Defaults to `0.9`.
 |      beta_2: A float value or a constant float tensor, or a callable
 |          that takes no arguments and returns the actual value to use. The
 |          exponential decay rate for the 1st moment estimate. Defaults to
 |          `0.99`.
 |      name: String. The name to use
 |          for momentum accumulator weights created by
 |          the optimizer.
 |      weight_decay: Float. If set, weight decay is applied.
 |      clipnorm: Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is individually
 |          clipped so that its norm is no higher than this value.
 |      clipvalue: Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is clipped to be
 |          no higher than this value.
 |      global_clipnorm: Float. If set, the gradient of all weights is clipped
 |          so that their global norm is no higher than this value.
 |      use_ema: Boolean, defaults to False. If True, exponential moving average
 |          (EMA) is applied. EMA consists of computing an exponential moving
 |          average of the weights of the model (as the weight values change
 |          after each training batch), and periodically overwriting the
 |          weights with their moving average.
 |      ema_momentum: Float, defaults to 0.99. Only used if `use_ema=True`.
 |          This is the momentum to use when computing
 |          the EMA of the model's weights:
 |          `new_average = ema_momentum * old_average + (1 - ema_momentum) *
 |          current_variable_value`.
 |      ema_overwrite_frequency: Int or None, defaults to None. Only used if
 |          `use_ema=True`. Every `ema_overwrite_frequency` steps of iterations,
 |          we overwrite the model variable by its moving average.
 |          If None, the optimizer
 |          does not overwrite model variables in the middle of training,
 |          and you need to explicitly overwrite the variables
 |          at the end of training by calling
 |          `optimizer.finalize_variable_values()` (which updates the model
 |          variables in-place). When using the built-in `fit()` training loop,
 |          this happens automatically after the last epoch,
 |          and you don't need to do anything.
 |      loss_scale_factor: Float or `None`. If a float, the scale factor will
 |          be multiplied the loss before computing gradients, and the inverse
 |          of the scale factor will be multiplied by the gradients before
 |          updating variables. Useful for preventing underflow during
 |          mixed precision training. Alternately,
 |          `keras.optimizers.LossScaleOptimizer` will
 |          automatically set a loss scale factor.
 |      gradient_accumulation_steps: Int or `None`. If an int, model & optimizer
 |          variables will not be updated at every step; instead they will be
 |          updated every `gradient_accumulation_steps` steps, using the average
 |          value of the gradients since the last update. This is known as
 |          "gradient accumulation". This can be useful
 |          when your batch size is very small, in order to reduce gradient
 |          noise at each update step.
