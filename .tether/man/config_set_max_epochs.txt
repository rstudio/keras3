keras.config.set_max_epochs(max_epochs)
__doc__
Limit the maximum number of epochs for any call to fit.

This will cap the number of epochs for any training run using `model.fit()`.
This is purely for debugging, and can also be set via the `KERAS_MAX_EPOCHS`
environment variable to quickly run a script without modifying its source.

Args:
    max_epochs: The integer limit on the number of epochs or `None`. If
        `None`, no limit is applied.
