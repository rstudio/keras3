Help on class Layer in module keras.src.layers.layer:

class Layer(keras.src.backend.tensorflow.layer.TFLayer, keras.src.ops.operation.Operation)
 |  Layer(*args, **kwargs)
 |
 |  This is the class from which all layers inherit.
 |
 |  A layer is a callable object that takes as input one or more tensors and
 |  that outputs one or more tensors. It involves *computation*, defined
 |  in the `call()` method, and a *state* (weight variables). State can be
 |  created:
 |
 |  * in `__init__()`, for instance via `self.add_weight()`;
 |  * in the optional `build()` method, which is invoked by the first
 |    `__call__()` to the layer, and supplies the shape(s) of the input(s),
 |    which may not have been known at initialization time.
 |
 |  Layers are recursively composable: If you assign a Layer instance as an
 |  attribute of another Layer, the outer layer will start tracking the weights
 |  created by the inner layer. Nested layers should be instantiated in the
 |  `__init__()` method or `build()` method.
 |
 |  Users will just instantiate a layer and then treat it as a callable.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      trainable: Boolean, whether the layer's variables should be trainable.
 |      name: String name of the layer.
 |      dtype: The dtype of the layer's computations and weights. Can also be a
 |          `keras.DTypePolicy`,
 |          which allows the computation and
 |          weight dtype to differ. Defaults to `None`. `None` means to use
 |          `keras.config.dtype_policy()`,
 |          which is a `float32` policy unless set to different value
 |          (via `keras.config.set_dtype_policy()`).
 |
 |  Attributes:
 |      name: The name of the layer (string).
 |      dtype: Dtype of the layer's weights. Alias of `layer.variable_dtype`.
 |      variable_dtype: Dtype of the layer's weights.
 |      compute_dtype: The dtype of the layer's computations.
 |          Layers automatically cast inputs to this dtype, which causes
 |          the computations and output to also be in this dtype.
 |          When mixed precision is used with a
 |          `keras.DTypePolicy`, this will be different
 |          than `variable_dtype`.
 |      trainable_weights: List of variables to be included in backprop.
 |      non_trainable_weights: List of variables that should not be
 |          included in backprop.
 |      weights: The concatenation of the lists trainable_weights and
 |          non_trainable_weights (in this order).
 |      trainable: Whether the layer should be trained (boolean), i.e.
 |          whether its potentially-trainable weights should be returned
 |          as part of `layer.trainable_weights`.
 |      input_spec: Optional (list of) `InputSpec` object(s) specifying the
 |          constraints on inputs that can be accepted by the layer.
 |
 |  We recommend that descendants of `Layer` implement the following methods:
 |
 |  * `__init__()`: Defines custom layer attributes, and creates layer weights
 |      that do not depend on input shapes, using `add_weight()`,
 |      or other state.
 |  * `build(self, input_shape)`: This method can be used to create weights that
 |      depend on the shape(s) of the input(s), using `add_weight()`, or other
 |      state. `__call__()` will automatically build the layer
 |      (if it has not been built yet) by calling `build()`.
 |  * `call(self, *args, **kwargs)`: Called in `__call__` after making
 |      sure `build()` has been called. `call()` performs the logic of applying
 |      the layer to the input arguments.
 |      Two reserved keyword arguments you can optionally use in `call()` are:
 |          1. `training` (boolean, whether the call is in inference mode or
 |              training mode).
 |          2. `mask` (boolean tensor encoding masked timesteps in the input,
 |              used e.g. in RNN layers).
 |      A typical signature for this method is `call(self, inputs)`, and user
 |      could optionally add `training` and `mask` if the layer need them.
 |  * `get_config(self)`: Returns a dictionary containing the configuration
 |      used to initialize this layer. If the keys differ from the arguments
 |      in `__init__()`, then override `from_config(self)` as well.
 |      This method is used when saving
 |      the layer or a model that contains this layer.
 |
 |  Examples:
 |
 |  Here's a basic example: a layer with two variables, `w` and `b`,
 |  that returns `y = w . x + b`.
 |  It shows how to implement `build()` and `call()`.
 |  Variables set as attributes of a layer are tracked as weights
 |  of the layers (in `layer.weights`).
 |
 |  ```python
 |  class SimpleDense(Layer):
 |      def __init__(self, units=32):
 |          super().__init__()
 |          self.units = units
 |
 |      # Create the state of the layer (weights)
 |      def build(self, input_shape):
 |          self.kernel = self.add_weight(
 |              shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
 |              initializer="glorot_uniform",
 |              trainable=True,
 |              name="kernel",
 |          )
 |          self.bias = self.add_weight(
 |              shape=(self.units,),
 |              initializer="zeros",
 |              trainable=True,
 |              name="bias",
 |          )
 |
 |      # Defines the computation
 |      def call(self, inputs):
 |          return ops.matmul(inputs, self.kernel) + self.bias
 |
 |  # Instantiates the layer.
 |  linear_layer = SimpleDense(4)
 |
 |  # This will also call `build(input_shape)` and create the weights.
 |  y = linear_layer(ops.ones((2, 2)))
 |  assert len(linear_layer.weights) == 2
 |
 |  # These weights are trainable, so they're listed in `trainable_weights`:
 |  assert len(linear_layer.trainable_weights) == 2
 |  ```
 |
 |  Besides trainable weights, updated via backpropagation during training,
 |  layers can also have non-trainable weights. These weights are meant to
 |  be updated manually during `call()`. Here's a example layer that computes
 |  the running sum of its inputs:
 |
 |  ```python
 |  class ComputeSum(Layer):
 |
 |    def __init__(self, input_dim):
 |        super(ComputeSum, self).__init__()
 |        # Create a non-trainable weight.
 |        self.total = self.add_weight(
 |          shape=(),
 |          initializer="zeros",
 |          trainable=False,
 |          name="total",
 |        )
 |
 |    def call(self, inputs):
 |        self.total.assign(self.total + ops.sum(inputs))
 |        return self.total
 |
 |  my_sum = ComputeSum(2)
 |  x = ops.ones((2, 2))
 |  y = my_sum(x)
 |
 |  assert my_sum.weights == [my_sum.total]
 |  assert my_sum.non_trainable_weights == [my_sum.total]
 |  assert my_sum.trainable_weights == []
 |  ```

 |      Add a weight variable to the layer.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          shape: Shape tuple for the variable. Must be fully-defined
 |              (no `None` entries). Defaults to `()` (scalar) if unspecified.
 |          initializer: Initializer object to use to populate the initial
 |              variable value, or string name of a built-in initializer
 |              (e.g. `"random_normal"`). If unspecified, defaults to
 |              `"glorot_uniform"` for floating-point variables and to `"zeros"`
 |              for all other types (e.g. int, bool).
 |          dtype: Dtype of the variable to create, e.g. `"float32"`. If
 |              unspecified, defaults to the layer's variable dtype
 |              (which itself defaults to `"float32"` if unspecified).
 |          trainable: Boolean, whether the variable should be trainable via

 |              optimizer update, or string name of a built-in constraint.
 |              Defaults to `None`.
 |          aggregation: String, one of `'mean'`, `'sum'`,
 |              `'only_first_replica'`. Annotates the variable with the type
 |              of multi-replica aggregation to be used for this variable
 |              when writing custom data parallel training loops.
 |          name: String name of the variable. Useful for debugging purposes.
 |
 |  build(self, input_shape)
 |
 |  build_from_config(self, config)
 |      Builds the layer's states with the supplied config dict.
 |
 |      By default, this method calls the `build(config["input_shape"])` method,
 |      which creates weights based on the layer's input shape in the supplied
 |      config. If your config contains other information needed to load the
 |      layer's state, you should override this method.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          config: Dict containing the input shape associated with this layer.
 |
 |  call(
 |    self,
 |    *args,
 |    **kwargs
 |  )
 |
 |  compute_mask(
 |    self,
 |    inputs,
 |    previous_mask
 |  )
 |
 |  compute_output_shape(
 |    self,
 |    *args,
 |    **kwargs
 |  )
 |
 |  compute_output_spec(
 |    self,
 |    *args,
 |    **kwargs
 |  )
 |
 |  count_params(self)
 |      Count the total number of scalars composing the weights.
 |
 |      Returns:
 |          An integer count.
 |
 |  get_build_config(self)
 |      Returns a dictionary with the layer's input shape.
 |
 |      This method returns a config dict that can be used by
 |      `build_from_config(config)` to create all states (e.g. Variables and
 |      Lookup tables) needed by the layer.
 |
 |      By default, the config only contains the input shape that the layer
 |      was built with. If you're writing a custom layer that creates state in
 |      an unusual way, you should override this method to make sure this state
 |      is already created when Keras attempts to load its value upon model
 |      loading.
 |
 |      Returns:
 |          A dict containing the input shape associated with the layer.
 |
 |  get_config(self)
 |      Returns the config of the object.
 |
 |      An object config is a Python dictionary (serializable)
 |      containing the information needed to re-instantiate it.
 |
 |  get_weights(self)
 |      Return the values of `layer.weights` as a list of NumPy arrays.
 |
 |  load_own_variables(self, store)
 |      Loads the state of the layer.
 |
 |      You can override this method to take full control of how the state of
 |      the layer is loaded upon calling `keras.models.load_model()`.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          store: Dict from which the state of the model will be loaded.
 |
 |  quantize(self, mode)
 |
 |  quantized_call(
 |    self,
 |    *args,
 |    **kwargs
 |  )
 |
 |  save_own_variables(self, store)
 |      Saves the state of the layer.
 |
 |      You can override this method to take full control of how the state of
 |      the layer is saved upon calling `model.save()`.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          store: Dict where the state of the model will be saved.
 |
 |  set_weights(self, weights)
 |      Sets the values of `layer.weights` from a list of NumPy arrays.
 |
 |  stateless_call(
 |    self,
 |    trainable_variables,
 |    non_trainable_variables,
 |    *args,
 |    return_losses=False,
 |    **kwargs
 |  )
 |      Call the layer without any side effects.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          trainable_variables: List of trainable variables of the model.
 |          non_trainable_variables: List of non-trainable variables of the
 |              model.
 |          *args: Positional arguments to be passed to `call()`.
 |          return_losses: If `True`, `stateless_call()` will return the list of
 |              losses created during `call()` as part of its return values.
 |          **kwargs: Keyword arguments to be passed to `call()`.
 |
 |      Returns:
 |          A tuple. By default, returns `(outputs, non_trainable_variables)`.
 |              If `return_losses = True`, then returns
 |              `(outputs, non_trainable_variables, losses)`.
 |
 |      Note: `non_trainable_variables` include not only non-trainable weights
 |      such as `BatchNormalization` statistics, but also RNG seed state
 |      (if there are any random operations part of the layer, such as dropout),
 |      and `Metric` state (if there are any metrics attached to the layer).
 |      These are all elements of state of the layer.
 |
 |      Example:
 |
 |      ```python
 |      model = ...
 |      data = ...
 |      trainable_variables = model.trainable_variables
 |      non_trainable_variables = model.non_trainable_variables
 |      # Call the model with zero side effects
 |      outputs, non_trainable_variables = model.stateless_call(
 |          trainable_variables,
 |          non_trainable_variables,
 |          data,
 |      )
 |      # Attach the updated state to the model
 |      # (until you do this, the model is still in its pre-call state).
 |      for ref_var, value in zip(
 |          model.non_trainable_variables, non_trainable_variables
 |      ):
 |          ref_var.assign(value)
 |      ```
