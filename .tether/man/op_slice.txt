keras.ops.slice(
  inputs,
  start_indices,
  shape
)
__doc__
Return a slice of an input tensor.

At a high level, this operation is an explicit replacement for array slicing
e.g. `inputs[start_indices: start_indices + shape]`.
Unlike slicing via brackets, this operation will accept tensor start
indices on all backends, which is useful when indices dynamically computed
via other tensor operations.

```python
inputs = np.zeros((5, 5))
start_indices = np.array([3, 3])
shape = np.array([2, 2])
inputs = keras.ops.slice(inputs, start_indices, shape)
```

Args:
    inputs: A tensor, the tensor to be updated.
    start_indices: A list/tuple of shape `(inputs.ndim,)`, specifying
        the starting indices for updating.
    shape: The full shape of the returned slice.

Returns:
    A tensor, has the same shape and dtype as `inputs`.
