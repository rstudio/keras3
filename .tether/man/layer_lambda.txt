Help on class Lambda in module keras.src.layers.core.lambda_layer:

class Lambda(keras.src.layers.layer.Layer)
 |  Lambda(function, output_shape=None, mask=None, arguments=None, **kwargs)
 |
 |  Wraps arbitrary expressions as a `Layer` object.
 |
 |  The `Lambda` layer exists so that arbitrary expressions can be used
 |  as a `Layer` when constructing Sequential
 |  and Functional API models. `Lambda` layers are best suited for simple
 |  operations or quick experimentation. For more advanced use cases,
 |  prefer writing new subclasses of `Layer`.
 |
 |  WARNING: `Lambda` layers have (de)serialization limitations!
 |
 |  The main reason to subclass `Layer` instead of using a
 |  `Lambda` layer is saving and inspecting a model. `Lambda` layers
 |  are saved by serializing the Python bytecode, which is fundamentally
 |  non-portable and potentially unsafe.
 |  They should only be loaded in the same environment where
 |  they were saved. Subclassed layers can be saved in a more portable way
 |  by overriding their `get_config()` method. Models that rely on
 |  subclassed Layers are also often easier to visualize and reason about.
 |
 |  Example:
 |
 |  ```python
 |  # add a x -> x^2 layer
 |  model.add(Lambda(lambda x: x ** 2))
 |  ```
 |
 |  Args:
 |      function: The function to be evaluated. Takes input tensor as first
 |          argument.
 |      output_shape: Expected output shape from function. This argument
 |          can usually be inferred if not explicitly provided.
 |          Can be a tuple or function. If a tuple, it only specifies
 |          the first dimension onward; sample dimension is assumed
 |          either the same as the input:
 |          `output_shape = (input_shape[0], ) + output_shape` or,
 |          the input is `None` and the sample dimension is also `None`:
 |          `output_shape = (None, ) + output_shape`.
 |          If a function, it specifies the
 |          entire shape as a function of the input shape:
 |          `output_shape = f(input_shape)`.
 |      mask: Either None (indicating no masking) or a callable with the same
 |          signature as the `compute_mask` layer method, or a tensor
 |          that will be returned as output mask regardless
 |          of what the input is.
 |      arguments: Optional dictionary of keyword arguments to be passed to the
 |          function.

 |
 |      An object config is a Python dictionary (serializable)
 |      containing the information needed to re-instantiate it.
 |

 |  Class methods defined here:
 |
 |  from_config(config, custom_objects=None, safe_mode=None) from builtins.type
 |      Creates a layer from its config.
 |
 |      This method is the reverse of `get_config`,
 |      capable of instantiating the same layer from the config
 |      dictionary. It does not handle layer connectivity
 |      (handled by Network), nor weights (handled by `set_weights`).
 |
 |      Args:
 |          config: A Python dictionary, typically the
 |              output of get_config.
 |
 |      Returns:
 |          A layer instance.
