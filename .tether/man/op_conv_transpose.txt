General N-D convolution transpose.

Also known as de-convolution. This ops supports 1D, 2D and 3D convolution.

Args:
    inputs: Tensor of rank N+2. `inputs` has shape
        `(batch_size,) + inputs_spatial_shape + (num_channels,)` if
        `data_format="channels_last"`, or
        `(batch_size, num_channels) + inputs_spatial_shape` if
        `data_format="channels_first"`.
    kernel: Tensor of rank N+2. `kernel` has shape
        [kernel_spatial_shape, num_output_channels, num_input_channels],
        `num_input_channels` should match the number of channels in
        `inputs`.
    strides: int or int tuple/list of `len(inputs_spatial_shape)`,
        specifying the strides of the convolution along each spatial
        dimension. If `strides` is int, then every spatial dimension shares
        the same `strides`.
    padding: string, either `"valid"` or `"same"`. `"valid"` means no
        padding is applied, and `"same"` results in padding evenly to the
        left/right or up/down of the input such that output has the
        same height/width dimension as the input when `strides=1`.
    output_padding: int or int tuple/list of `len(inputs_spatial_shape)`,
        specifying the amount of padding along the height and width of
        the output tensor. Can be a single integer to specify the same
        value for all spatial dimensions. The amount of output padding
        along a given dimension must be lower than the stride along that
        same dimension. If set to `None` (default), the output shape is
        inferred.
    data_format: A string, either `"channels_last"` or `"channels_first"`.
        `data_format` determines the ordering of the dimensions in the
        inputs. If `data_format="channels_last"`, `inputs` is of shape
        `(batch_size, ..., channels)` while if
        `data_format="channels_first"`, `inputs` is of shape
        `(batch_size, channels, ...)`.
    dilation_rate: int or int tuple/list of `len(inputs_spatial_shape)`,
        specifying the dilation rate to use for dilated convolution. If
        `dilation_rate` is int, then every spatial dimension shares
        the same `dilation_rate`.

Returns:
    A tensor of rank N+2, the result of the conv operation.
