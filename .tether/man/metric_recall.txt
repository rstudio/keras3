Help on class Recall in module keras.src.metrics.confusion_metrics:

class Recall(keras.src.metrics.metric.Metric)
 |  Recall(thresholds=None, top_k=None, class_id=None, name=None, dtype=None)
 |
 |  Computes the recall of the predictions with respect to the labels.
 |
 |  This metric creates two local variables, `true_positives` and
 |  `false_negatives`, that are used to compute the recall. This value is
 |  ultimately returned as `recall`, an idempotent operation that simply divides
 |  `true_positives` by the sum of `true_positives` and `false_negatives`.
 |
 |  If `sample_weight` is `None`, weights default to 1.
 |  Use `sample_weight` of 0 to mask values.
 |
 |  If `top_k` is set, recall will be computed as how often on average a class
 |  among the labels of a batch entry is in the top-k predictions.
 |
 |  If `class_id` is specified, we calculate recall by considering only the
 |  entries in the batch for which `class_id` is in the label, and computing the
 |  fraction of them for which `class_id` is above the threshold and/or in the
 |  top-k predictions.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      thresholds: (Optional) A float value, or a Python list/tuple of float
 |          threshold values in `[0, 1]`. A threshold is compared with
 |          prediction values to determine the truth value of predictions (i.e.,
 |          above the threshold is `True`, below is `False`). If used with a
 |          loss function that sets `from_logits=True` (i.e. no sigmoid
 |          applied to predictions), `thresholds` should be set to 0.
 |          One metric value is generated for each threshold value.
 |          If neither `thresholds` nor `top_k` are set,
 |          the default is to calculate recall with `thresholds=0.5`.
 |      top_k: (Optional) Unset by default. An int value specifying the top-k
 |          predictions to consider when calculating recall.
 |      class_id: (Optional) Integer class ID for which we want binary metrics.
 |          This must be in the half-open interval `[0, num_classes)`, where
 |          `num_classes` is the last dimension of predictions.
 |      name: (Optional) string name of the metric instance.
 |      dtype: (Optional) data type of the metric result.
 |
 |  Standalone usage:
 |
 |  >>> m = keras.metrics.Recall()
 |  >>> m.update_state([0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1])
 |  >>> m.result()
 |  0.6666667
 |
 |  >>> m.reset_state()
 |  >>> m.update_state([0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], sample_weight=[0, 0, 1, 0])
 |  >>> m.result()
 |  1.0
 |
 |  Usage with `compile()` API:
 |
 |  ```python
 |  model.compile(optimizer='sgd',
 |                loss='binary_crossentropy',
 |                metrics=[keras.metrics.Recall()])
 |  ```
 |
 |  Usage with a loss with `from_logits=True`:
 |
 |  ```python
 |  model.compile(optimizer='adam',
 |                loss=keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
 |                metrics=[keras.metrics.Recall(thresholds=0)])
 |  ```

 |
 |  __init__(
 |    self,
 |    thresholds=None,
 |    top_k=None,
 |    class_id=None,
 |    name=None,
 |    dtype=None
 |  )
 |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |
 |  get_config(self)
 |      Return the serializable config of the metric.
 |
 |  reset_state(self)
 |      Reset all of the metric state variables.
 |
 |      This function is called between epochs/steps,
 |      when a metric is evaluated during training.
 |
 |  result(self)
 |      Compute the current metric value.
 |
 |      Returns:
 |          A scalar tensor, or a dictionary of scalar tensors.
 |
 |  update_state(
 |    self,
 |    y_true,
 |    y_pred,
 |    sample_weight=None
 |  )
 |      Accumulates true positive and false negative statistics.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          y_true: The ground truth values, with the same dimensions as
 |              `y_pred`. Will be cast to `bool`.
 |          y_pred: The predicted values. Each element must be in the range
 |              `[0, 1]`.
 |          sample_weight: Optional weighting of each example. Defaults to `1`.
 |              Can be a tensor whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as
 |              `y_true`, and must be broadcastable to `y_true`.
