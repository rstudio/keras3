Help on class TensorBoard in module keras.src.callbacks.tensorboard:

class TensorBoard(keras.src.callbacks.callback.Callback)
 |  TensorBoard(log_dir='logs', histogram_freq=0, write_graph=True, write_images=False, write_steps_per_second=False, update_freq='epoch', profile_batch=0, embeddings_freq=0, embeddings_metadata=None)
 |
 |  Enable visualizations for TensorBoard.
 |
 |  TensorBoard is a visualization tool provided with TensorFlow. A TensorFlow
 |  installation is required to use this callback.
 |
 |  This callback logs events for TensorBoard, including:
 |
 |  * Metrics summary plots
 |  * Training graph visualization
 |  * Weight histograms
 |  * Sampled profiling
 |
 |  When used in `model.evaluate()` or regular validation
 |  in addition to epoch summaries, there will be a summary that records
 |  evaluation metrics vs `model.optimizer.iterations` written. The metric names
 |  will be prepended with `evaluation`, with `model.optimizer.iterations` being
 |  the step in the visualized TensorBoard.
 |
 |  If you have installed TensorFlow with pip, you should be able
 |  to launch TensorBoard from the command line:
 |
 |  ```
 |  tensorboard --logdir=path_to_your_logs
 |  ```
 |
 |  You can find more information about TensorBoard
 |  [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/summaries_and_tensorboard).
 |
 |  Args:
 |      log_dir: the path of the directory where to save the log files to be
 |          parsed by TensorBoard. e.g.,
 |          `log_dir = os.path.join(working_dir, 'logs')`.
 |          This directory should not be reused by any other callbacks.
 |      histogram_freq: frequency (in epochs) at which to compute
 |          weight histograms for the layers of the model. If set to 0,
 |          histograms won't be computed. Validation data (or split) must be
 |          specified for histogram visualizations.
 |      write_graph:  (Not supported at this time)
 |          Whether to visualize the graph in TensorBoard.
 |          Note that the log file can become quite large
 |          when `write_graph` is set to `True`.
 |      write_images: whether to write model weights to visualize as image in
 |          TensorBoard.
 |      write_steps_per_second: whether to log the training steps per second
 |          into TensorBoard. This supports both epoch and batch frequency
 |          logging.
 |      update_freq: `"batch"` or `"epoch"` or integer. When using `"epoch"`,
 |          writes the losses and metrics to TensorBoard after every epoch.
 |          If using an integer, let's say `1000`, all metrics and losses
 |          (including custom ones added by `Model.compile`) will be logged to
 |          TensorBoard every 1000 batches. `"batch"` is a synonym for 1,
 |          meaning that they will be written every batch.
 |          Note however that writing too frequently to TensorBoard can slow
 |          down your training, especially when used with distribution
 |          strategies as it will incur additional synchronization overhead.
 |          Batch-level summary writing is also available via `train_step`
 |          override. Please see
 |          [TensorBoard Scalars tutorial](
 |              https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/scalars_and_keras#batch-level_logging)
 |          for more details.
 |      profile_batch: Profile the batch(es) to sample compute characteristics.
 |          profile_batch must be a non-negative integer or a tuple of integers.
 |          A pair of positive integers signify a range of batches to profile.
 |          By default, profiling is disabled.
 |      embeddings_freq: frequency (in epochs) at which embedding layers will be
 |          visualized. If set to 0, embeddings won't be visualized.
 |      embeddings_metadata: Dictionary which maps embedding layer names to the
 |          filename of a file in which to save metadata for the embedding layer.
 |          In case the same metadata file is to be
 |          used for all embedding layers, a single filename can be passed.
 |
 |  Examples:
 |
 |  ```python
 |  tensorboard_callback = keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir="./logs")
 |  model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
 |  # Then run the tensorboard command to view the visualizations.
 |  ```
 |
 |  Custom batch-level summaries in a subclassed Model:
 |
 |  ```python
 |  class MyModel(keras.Model):
 |
 |      def build(self, _):
 |          self.dense = keras.layers.Dense(10)
 |
 |      def call(self, x):
 |          outputs = self.dense(x)
 |          tf.summary.histogram('outputs', outputs)
 |          return outputs
 |
 |  model = MyModel()
 |  model.compile('sgd', 'mse')
 |
 |  # Make sure to set `update_freq=N` to log a batch-level summary every N
 |  # batches.  In addition to any `tf.summary` contained in `model.call()`,
 |  # metrics added in `Model.compile` will be logged every N batches.
 |  tb_callback = keras.callbacks.TensorBoard('./logs', update_freq=1)
 |  model.fit(x_train, y_train, callbacks=[tb_callback])
 |  ```
 |
 |  Custom batch-level summaries in a Functional API Model:
 |
 |  ```python
 |  def my_summary(x):
 |      tf.summary.histogram('x', x)
 |      return x
 |
 |  inputs = keras.Input(10)
 |  x = keras.layers.Dense(10)(inputs)
 |  outputs = keras.layers.Lambda(my_summary)(x)
 |  model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
 |  model.compile('sgd', 'mse')
 |
 |  # Make sure to set `update_freq=N` to log a batch-level summary every N
 |  # batches. In addition to any `tf.summary` contained in `Model.call`,
 |  # metrics added in `Model.compile` will be logged every N batches.
 |  tb_callback = keras.callbacks.TensorBoard('./logs', update_freq=1)
 |  model.fit(x_train, y_train, callbacks=[tb_callback])
 |  ```
 |
 |  Profiling:
 |
 |  ```python
 |  # Profile a single batch, e.g. the 5th batch.
 |  tensorboard_callback = keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(
 |      log_dir='./logs', profile_batch=5)
 |  model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
 |
 |  # Profile a range of batches, e.g. from 10 to 20.
 |  tensorboard_callback = keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(
 |      log_dir='./logs', profile_batch=(10,20))
 |  model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
