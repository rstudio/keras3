class MelSpectrogram(keras.src.layers.preprocessing.tf_data_layer.TFDataLayer)
 |  MelSpectrogram(fft_length=2048, sequence_stride=512, sequence_length=None, window='hann', sampling_rate=16000, num_mel_bins=128, min_freq=20.0, max_freq=None, power_to_db=True, top_db=80.0, mag_exp=2.0, min_power=1e-10, ref_power=1.0, **kwargs)
 |
 |  A preprocessing layer to convert raw audio signals to Mel spectrograms.
 |
 |  This layer takes `float32`/`float64` single or batched audio signal as
 |  inputs and computes the Mel spectrogram using Short-Time Fourier Transform
 |  and Mel scaling. The input should be a 1D (unbatched) or 2D (batched) tensor
 |  representing audio signals. The output will be a 2D or 3D tensor
 |  representing Mel spectrograms.
 |
 |  A spectrogram is an image-like representation that shows the frequency
 |  spectrum of a signal over time. It uses x-axis to represent time, y-axis to
 |  represent frequency, and each pixel to represent intensity.
 |  Mel spectrograms are a special type of spectrogram that use the mel scale,
 |  which approximates how humans perceive sound. They are commonly used in
 |  speech and music processing tasks like speech recognition, speaker
 |  identification, and music genre classification.

 |  Input shape:
 |      1D (unbatched) or 2D (batched) tensor with shape:`(..., samples)`.
 |
 |  Output shape:
 |      2D (unbatched) or 3D (batched) tensor with
 |      shape:`(..., num_mel_bins, time)`.
 |
 |  Args:

 |      window: String, name of the window function to use. Available values
 |          are `"hann"` and `"hamming"`. If `window` is a tensor, it will be

 |
 |  compute_output_shape(self, input_shape)
 |
 |  get_config(self)
 |      Returns the config of the object.
 |
 |      An object config is a Python dictionary (serializable)
 |      containing the information needed to re-instantiate it.

 |  linear_to_mel_weight_matrix(
 |    self,
 |    num_mel_bins=20,
 |    num_spectrogram_bins=129,
 |    sampling_rate=8000,
 |    lower_edge_hertz=125.0,
 |    upper_edge_hertz=3800.0,
 |    dtype='float32'
 |  )
 |      Returns a matrix to warp linear scale spectrograms to the mel scale.
 |
 |      Returns a weight matrix that can be used to re-weight a tensor
 |      containing `num_spectrogram_bins` linearly sampled frequency information
 |      from `[0, sampling_rate / 2]` into `num_mel_bins` frequency information
 |      from `[lower_edge_hertz, upper_edge_hertz]` on the mel scale.
 |
 |      This function follows the [Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK)](
 |      http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/) convention, defining the mel scale in
 |      terms of a frequency in hertz according to the following formula:
 |
 |      ```mel(f) = 2595 * log10( 1 + f/700)```
 |
 |      In the returned matrix, all the triangles (filterbanks) have a peak
 |      value of 1.0.
 |
 |      For example, the returned matrix `A` can be used to right-multiply a
 |      spectrogram `S` of shape `[frames, num_spectrogram_bins]` of linear
 |      scale spectrum values (e.g. STFT magnitudes) to generate a
 |      "mel spectrogram" `M` of shape `[frames, num_mel_bins]`.
 |
 |      ```
 |      # `S` has shape [frames, num_spectrogram_bins]
 |      # `M` has shape [frames, num_mel_bins]
 |      M = keras.ops.matmul(S, A)
 |      ```
 |
 |      The matrix can be used with `keras.ops.tensordot` to convert an
 |      arbitrary rank `Tensor` of linear-scale spectral bins into the
 |      mel scale.
 |
 |      ```
 |      # S has shape [..., num_spectrogram_bins].
 |      # M has shape [..., num_mel_bins].
 |      M = keras.ops.tensordot(S, A, 1)
 |      ```

 |
 |      Args:
 |          num_mel_bins: Python int. How many bands in the resulting
 |              mel spectrum.
 |          num_spectrogram_bins: An integer `Tensor`. How many bins there are
 |              in the source spectrogram data, which is understood to be
 |              `fft_size // 2 + 1`, i.e. the spectrogram only contains the
 |              nonredundant FFT bins.
 |          sampling_rate: An integer or float `Tensor`. Samples per second of
 |              the input signal used to create the spectrogram. Used to figure
 |              out the frequencies corresponding to each spectrogram bin,
 |              which dictates how they are mapped into the mel scale.
 |          lower_edge_hertz: Python float. Lower bound on the frequencies to be
 |              included in the mel spectrum. This corresponds to the lower
 |              edge of the lowest triangular band.
 |          upper_edge_hertz: Python float. The desired top edge of the highest
 |              frequency band.
 |          dtype: The `DType` of the result matrix. Must be a floating point
 |              type.
 |
 |      Returns:
 |          A tensor of shape `[num_spectrogram_bins, num_mel_bins]`.
