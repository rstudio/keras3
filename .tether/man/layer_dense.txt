Help on class Dense in module keras.src.layers.core.dense:

class Dense(keras.src.layers.layer.Layer)
 |  Dense(units, activation=None, use_bias=True, kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform', bias_initializer='zeros', kernel_regularizer=None, bias_regularizer=None, activity_regularizer=None, kernel_constraint=None, bias_constraint=None, lora_rank=None, **kwargs)
 |
 |  Just your regular densely-connected NN layer.
 |
 |  `Dense` implements the operation:
 |  `output = activation(dot(input, kernel) + bias)`
 |  where `activation` is the element-wise activation function
 |  passed as the `activation` argument, `kernel` is a weights matrix
 |  created by the layer, and `bias` is a bias vector created by the layer
 |  (only applicable if `use_bias` is `True`).
 |
 |  Note: If the input to the layer has a rank greater than 2, `Dense`
 |  computes the dot product between the `inputs` and the `kernel` along the
 |  last axis of the `inputs` and axis 0 of the `kernel` (using `tf.tensordot`).
 |  For example, if input has dimensions `(batch_size, d0, d1)`, then we create
 |  a `kernel` with shape `(d1, units)`, and the `kernel` operates along axis 2
 |  of the `input`, on every sub-tensor of shape `(1, 1, d1)` (there are
 |  `batch_size * d0` such sub-tensors). The output in this case will have
 |  shape `(batch_size, d0, units)`.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      units: Positive integer, dimensionality of the output space.
 |      activation: Activation function to use.
 |          If you don't specify anything, no activation is applied
 |          (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`).
 |      use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
 |      kernel_initializer: Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix.
 |      bias_initializer: Initializer for the bias vector.
 |      kernel_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
 |          the `kernel` weights matrix.
 |      bias_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the bias vector.
 |      activity_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
 |          the output of the layer (its "activation").
 |      kernel_constraint: Constraint function applied to
 |          the `kernel` weights matrix.
 |      bias_constraint: Constraint function applied to the bias vector.
 |      lora_rank: Optional integer. If set, the layer's forward pass
 |          will implement LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
 |          with the provided rank. LoRA sets the layer's kernel
 |          to non-trainable and replaces it with a delta over the
 |          original kernel, obtained via multiplying two lower-rank
 |          trainable matrices. This can be useful to reduce the
 |          computation cost of fine-tuning large dense layers.
 |          You can also enable LoRA on an existing
 |          `Dense` layer by calling `layer.enable_lora(rank)`.
 |
 |  Input shape:
 |      N-D tensor with shape: `(batch_size, ..., input_dim)`.
 |      The most common situation would be
 |      a 2D input with shape `(batch_size, input_dim)`.
 |
 |  Output shape:
 |      N-D tensor with shape: `(batch_size, ..., units)`.
 |      For instance, for a 2D input with shape `(batch_size, input_dim)`,
 |      the output would have shape `(batch_size, units)`.
