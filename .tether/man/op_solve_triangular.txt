)
__doc__
Solves a linear system of equations given by `a x = b`.

Args:
    a: A tensor of shape `(..., M, M)` representing the coefficients matrix.
    b: A tensor of shape `(..., M)` or `(..., M, N)` representing the
    right-hand side or "dependent variable" matrix.

Returns:
    A tensor of shape `(..., M)` or `(..., M, N)` representing the solution
    of the linear system. Returned shape is identical to `b`.
