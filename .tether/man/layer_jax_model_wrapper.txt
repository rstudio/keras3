Help on class JaxLayer in module keras.src.utils.jax_layer:

class JaxLayer(keras.src.layers.layer.Layer)
 |  JaxLayer(call_fn, init_fn=None, params=None, state=None, seed=None, **kwargs)
 |
 |  Keras Layer that wraps a JAX model.
 |
 |  This layer enables the use of JAX components within Keras when using JAX as
 |  the backend for Keras.
 |
 |  ## Model function
 |
 |  This layer accepts JAX models in the form of a function, `call_fn`, which
 |  must take the following arguments with these exact names:
 |
 |  - `params`: trainable parameters of the model.
 |  - `state` (*optional*): non-trainable state of the model. Can be omitted if
 |      the model has no non-trainable state.
 |  - `rng` (*optional*): a `jax.random.PRNGKey` instance. Can be omitted if the
 |      model does not need RNGs, neither during training nor during inference.
 |  - `inputs`: inputs to the model, a JAX array or a `PyTree` of arrays.
 |  - `training` (*optional*): an argument specifying if we're in training mode
 |      or inference mode, `True` is passed in training mode. Can be omitted if
 |      the model behaves the same in training mode and inference mode.
 |
 |  The `inputs` argument is mandatory. Inputs to the model must be provided via
 |  a single argument. If the JAX model takes multiple inputs as separate
 |  arguments, they must be combined into a single structure, for instance in a
 |  `tuple` or a `dict`.
 |
 |  ## Model weights initialization
 |
 |  The initialization of the `params` and `state` of the model can be handled
 |  by this layer, in which case the `init_fn` argument must be provided. This
 |  allows the model to be initialized dynamically with the right shape.
 |  Alternatively, and if the shape is known, the `params` argument and
 |  optionally the `state` argument can be used to create an already initialized
 |  model.
 |
 |  The `init_fn` function, if provided, must take the following arguments with
 |  these exact names:
 |
 |  - `rng`: a `jax.random.PRNGKey` instance.
 |  - `inputs`: a JAX array or a `PyTree` of arrays with placeholder values to
 |      provide the shape of the inputs.
 |  - `training` (*optional*): an argument specifying if we're in training mode
 |      or inference mode. `True` is always passed to `init_fn`. Can be omitted
 |      regardless of whether `call_fn` has a `training` argument.
 |
 |  ## Models with non-trainable state
 |
 |  For JAX models that have non-trainable state:
 |
 |  - `call_fn` must have a `state` argument
 |  - `call_fn` must return a `tuple` containing the outputs of the model and
 |      the new non-trainable state of the model
 |  - `init_fn` must return a `tuple` containing the initial trainable params of
 |      the model and the initial non-trainable state of the model.
 |
 |  This code shows a possible combination of `call_fn` and `init_fn` signatures
 |  for a model with non-trainable state. In this example, the model has a
 |  `training` argument and an `rng` argument in `call_fn`.
 |
 |  ```python
 |  def stateful_call(params, state, rng, inputs, training):
 |      outputs = ...
 |      new_state = ...
 |      return outputs, new_state
 |
 |  def stateful_init(rng, inputs):
 |      initial_params = ...
 |      initial_state = ...
 |      return initial_params, initial_state
 |  ```
 |
 |  ## Models without non-trainable state
 |
 |  For JAX models with no non-trainable state:
 |
 |  - `call_fn` must not have a `state` argument
 |  - `call_fn` must return only the outputs of the model
 |  - `init_fn` must return only the initial trainable params of the model.
 |
 |  This code shows a possible combination of `call_fn` and `init_fn` signatures
 |  for a model without non-trainable state. In this example, the model does not
 |  have a `training` argument and does not have an `rng` argument in `call_fn`.
 |
 |  ```python
 |  def stateless_call(params, inputs):
 |      outputs = ...
 |      return outputs
 |
 |  def stateless_init(rng, inputs):
 |      initial_params = ...
 |      return initial_params
 |  ```
 |
 |  ## Conforming to the required signature
 |
 |  If a model has a different signature than the one required by `JaxLayer`,
 |  one can easily write a wrapper method to adapt the arguments. This example
 |  shows a model that has multiple inputs as separate arguments, expects
 |  multiple RNGs in a `dict`, and has a `deterministic` argument with the
 |  opposite meaning of `training`. To conform, the inputs are combined in a
 |  single structure using a `tuple`, the RNG is split and used the populate the
 |  expected `dict`, and the Boolean flag is negated:
 |
 |  ```python
 |  def my_model_fn(params, rngs, input1, input2, deterministic):
 |      ...
 |      if not deterministic:
 |          dropout_rng = rngs["dropout"]
 |          keep = jax.random.bernoulli(dropout_rng, dropout_rate, x.shape)
 |          x = jax.numpy.where(keep, x / dropout_rate, 0)
 |          ...
 |      ...
 |      return outputs
 |
 |  def my_model_wrapper_fn(params, rng, inputs, training):
 |      input1, input2 = inputs
 |      rng1, rng2 = jax.random.split(rng)
 |      rngs = {"dropout": rng1, "preprocessing": rng2}
 |      deterministic = not training
 |      return my_model_fn(params, rngs, input1, input2, deterministic)
 |
 |  keras_layer = JaxLayer(my_model_wrapper_fn, params=initial_params)
 |  ```
 |
 |  ## Usage with Haiku modules
 |
 |  `JaxLayer` enables the use of [Haiku](https://dm-haiku.readthedocs.io)
 |  components in the form of
 |  [`haiku.Module`](https://dm-haiku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#module).
 |  This is achieved by transforming the module per the Haiku pattern and then
 |  passing `module.apply` in the `call_fn` parameter and `module.init` in the
 |  `init_fn` parameter if needed.
 |
 |  If the model has non-trainable state, it should be transformed with
 |  [`haiku.transform_with_state`](
 |    https://dm-haiku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#haiku.transform_with_state).
 |  If the model has no non-trainable state, it should be transformed with
 |  [`haiku.transform`](
 |    https://dm-haiku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#haiku.transform).
 |  Additionally, and optionally, if the module does not use RNGs in "apply", it
 |  can be transformed with
 |  [`haiku.without_apply_rng`](
 |    https://dm-haiku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#without-apply-rng).
 |
 |  The following example shows how to create a `JaxLayer` from a Haiku module
 |  that uses random number generators via `hk.next_rng_key()` and takes a
 |  training positional argument:
 |
 |  ```python
 |  class MyHaikuModule(hk.Module):
 |      def __call__(self, x, training):
 |          x = hk.Conv2D(32, (3, 3))(x)
 |          x = jax.nn.relu(x)
 |          x = hk.AvgPool((1, 2, 2, 1), (1, 2, 2, 1), "VALID")(x)
 |          x = hk.Flatten()(x)
 |          x = hk.Linear(200)(x)
 |          if training:
 |              x = hk.dropout(rng=hk.next_rng_key(), rate=0.3, x=x)
 |          x = jax.nn.relu(x)
 |          x = hk.Linear(10)(x)
 |          x = jax.nn.softmax(x)
 |          return x
 |
 |  def my_haiku_module_fn(inputs, training):
 |      module = MyHaikuModule()
 |      return module(inputs, training)
 |
 |  transformed_module = hk.transform(my_haiku_module_fn)
 |
 |  keras_layer = JaxLayer(
 |      call_fn=transformed_module.apply,
 |      init_fn=transformed_module.init,
 |  )
 |  ```
 |
 |  Args:
 |      call_fn: The function to call the model. See description above for the
 |          list of arguments it takes and the outputs it returns.
 |      init_fn: the function to call to initialize the model. See description
 |          above for the list of arguments it takes and the ouputs it returns.
 |          If `None`, then `params` and/or `state` must be provided.
 |    params: A `PyTree` containing all the model trainable parameters. This
 |          allows passing trained parameters or controlling the initialization.
 |          If both `params` and `state` are `None`, `init_fn` is called at
 |          build time to initialize the trainable parameters of the model.
 |    state: A `PyTree` containing all the model non-trainable state. This
 |          allows passing learned state or controlling the initialization. If
 |          both `params` and `state` are `None`, and `call_fn` takes a `state`
 |          argument, then `init_fn` is called at build time to initialize the
 |          non-trainable state of the model.
 |    seed: Seed for random number generator. Optional.

 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Class methods defined here:
 |
 |  from_config(config)
 |      Creates an operation from its config.
 |
 |      This method is the reverse of `get_config`, capable of instantiating the
 |      same operation from the config dictionary.
 |
 |      Note: If you override this method, you might receive a serialized dtype
 |      config, which is a `dict`. You can deserialize it as follows:
 |
 |      ```python
 |      if "dtype" in config and isinstance(config["dtype"], dict):
 |          policy = dtype_policies.deserialize(config["dtype"])
 |      ```
 |
 |      Args:
 |          config: A Python dictionary, typically the output of `get_config`.
 |
 |      Returns:
 |          An operation instance.
