__doc__
Scaled dot product attention function.

Computes the attention function on Q (`query`), K (`key`), and V(`value`):
`attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(Q * K / sqrt(d)) * V`. If we define `logits`
as the output of `Q * K` and the `probs` as the output of `softmax`.

Throughout this function, we utilize the following notation to represent the
shape of array:
- B: batch size
- S: length of the key/value
- T: length of the query
- N: number of attention heads
- H: dimensions of each attention head
- K: number of key/value heads
- G: number of groups, which equals to `N // K`

Args:
    query: The query array with the shape of `(B, T, N, H)`.
    key: The key array with the shape of `(B, S, K, H)`. When `K` equals
        `N`, multi-headed attention (MHA) is performed. Otherwise, grouped
        query attention (GQA) is performed if `N` is a multiple of `K`. and
        multi-query attention (MQA) is performed if `K==1` (a special case
        of GQA).
    value: The value array with the same shape of `key`.
    bias: Optional bias array to be added to logits. The shape must be
        broadcastable to `(B, N, T, S)`.
    mask: Optional mask array used to filter out logits. It is a boolean
        mask where `True` indicates the element should take part in
        attention. For an additive mask, users should pass it to bias. The
        shape must be broadcastable to `(B, N, T, S)`.
    scale: Optional scale for the logits. If `None`, the scale will be set
        to `1.0 / sqrt(H)`.
    is_causal: Whether to apply causal mask.
    flash_attention: Whether to use flash attention. If `None`, it will
        attempt to use flash attention if the required conditions are met.
        Typically, the inputs must be in float16 and bfloat16 dtype and the
        input layout requirements may vary depending on the backend.

Returns:
    An array of the attention output with the same shape of `query`.

Example:

>>> query = keras.random.normal((2, 4, 8, 16))
>>> key = keras.random.normal((2, 6, 8, 16))
>>> value = keras.random.normal((2, 6, 8, 16))
>>> keras.ops.nn.dot_product_attention(query, key, value).shape
(2, 4, 8, 16)
