Help on class RandomZoom in module keras.src.layers.preprocessing.random_zoom:

class RandomZoom(keras.src.layers.preprocessing.tf_data_layer.TFDataLayer)
 |  RandomZoom(height_factor, width_factor=None, fill_mode='reflect', interpolation='bilinear', seed=None, fill_value=0.0, data_format=None, **kwargs)
 |
 |  A preprocessing layer which randomly zooms images during training.
 |
 |  This layer will randomly zoom in or out on each axis of an image
 |  independently, filling empty space according to `fill_mode`.
 |
 |  Input pixel values can be of any range (e.g. `[0., 1.)` or `[0, 255]`) and
 |  of integer or floating point dtype.
 |  By default, the layer will output floats.
 |
 |  Input shape:
 |      3D (unbatched) or 4D (batched) tensor with shape:
 |      `(..., height, width, channels)`, in `"channels_last"` format,
 |      or `(..., channels, height, width)`, in `"channels_first"` format.
 |
 |  Output shape:
 |      3D (unbatched) or 4D (batched) tensor with shape:
 |      `(..., target_height, target_width, channels)`,
 |      or `(..., channels, target_height, target_width)`,
 |      in `"channels_first"` format.
 |
 |  **Note:** This layer is safe to use inside a `tf.data` pipeline
 |  (independently of which backend you're using).
 |
 |  Args:
 |      height_factor: a float represented as fraction of value, or a tuple of
 |          size 2 representing lower and upper bound for zooming vertically.
 |          When represented as a single float, this value is used for both the
 |          upper and lower bound. A positive value means zooming out, while a
 |          negative value means zooming in. For instance,
 |          `height_factor=(0.2, 0.3)` result in an output zoomed out by a
 |          random amount in the range `[+20%, +30%]`.
 |          `height_factor=(-0.3, -0.2)` result in an output zoomed in by a
 |          random amount in the range `[+20%, +30%]`.
 |      width_factor: a float represented as fraction of value, or a tuple of
 |          size 2 representing lower and upper bound for zooming horizontally.
 |          When represented as a single float, this value is used for both the
 |          upper and lower bound. For instance, `width_factor=(0.2, 0.3)`
 |          result in an output zooming out between 20% to 30%.
 |          `width_factor=(-0.3, -0.2)` result in an output zooming in between
 |          20% to 30%. `None` means i.e., zooming vertical and horizontal
 |          directions by preserving the aspect ratio. Defaults to `None`.
 |      fill_mode: Points outside the boundaries of the input are filled
 |          according to the given mode. Available methods are `"constant"`,
 |          `"nearest"`, `"wrap"` and `"reflect"`. Defaults to `"constant"`.
 |          - `"reflect"`: `(d c b a | a b c d | d c b a)`
 |              The input is extended by reflecting about the edge of the last
 |              pixel.
 |          - `"constant"`: `(k k k k | a b c d | k k k k)`
 |              The input is extended by filling all values beyond
 |              the edge with the same constant value k specified by
 |              `fill_value`.
 |          - `"wrap"`: `(a b c d | a b c d | a b c d)`
 |              The input is extended by wrapping around to the opposite edge.
 |          - `"nearest"`: `(a a a a | a b c d | d d d d)`
 |              The input is extended by the nearest pixel.
 |          Note that when using torch backend, `"reflect"` is redirected to
 |          `"mirror"` `(c d c b | a b c d | c b a b)` because torch does not
 |          support `"reflect"`.
 |          Note that torch backend does not support `"wrap"`.
 |      interpolation: Interpolation mode. Supported values: `"nearest"`,
 |          `"bilinear"`.
 |      seed: Integer. Used to create a random seed.
 |      fill_value: a float represents the value to be filled outside
 |          the boundaries when `fill_mode="constant"`.
 |      data_format: string, either `"channels_last"` or `"channels_first"`.
 |          The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. `"channels_last"`
 |          corresponds to inputs with shape `(batch, height, width, channels)`
 |          while `"channels_first"` corresponds to inputs with shape
 |          `(batch, channels, height, width)`. It defaults to the
 |          `image_data_format` value found in your Keras config file at
 |          `~/.keras/keras.json`. If you never set it, then it will be
 |          `"channels_last"`.
 |      **kwargs: Base layer keyword arguments, such as `name` and `dtype`.
 |
 |  Example:
 |
 |  >>> input_img = np.random.random((32, 224, 224, 3))
 |  >>> layer = keras.layers.RandomZoom(.5, .2)
 |  >>> out_img = layer(input_img)
