\arguments{
\item{learning_rate}{A float, a
\code{\link[=LearningRateSchedule]{LearningRateSchedule()}} instance, or
a callable that takes no arguments and returns the actual value to
use. The learning rate. Defaults to \code{0.001}.}

\item{beta_1}{A float value or a constant float tensor, or a callable
that takes no arguments and returns the actual value to use. The
rate to combine the current gradient and the 1st moment estimate.
Defaults to \code{0.9}.}

\item{beta_2}{A float value or a constant float tensor, or a callable
that takes no arguments and returns the actual value to use. The
exponential decay rate for the 1st moment estimate. Defaults to
\code{0.99}.}

\item{weight_decay}{Float. If set, weight decay is applied.}

\item{clipnorm}{Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is individually
clipped so that its norm is no higher than this value.}

\item{clipvalue}{Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is clipped to be
no higher than this value.}

\item{global_clipnorm}{Float. If set, the gradient of all weights is clipped
so that their global norm is no higher than this value.}

\item{use_ema}{Boolean, defaults to \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, exponential moving average
(EMA) is applied. EMA consists of computing an exponential moving
average of the weights of the model (as the weight values change after
each training batch), and periodically overwriting the weights with
their moving average.}

\item{ema_momentum}{Float, defaults to 0.99. Only used if \code{use_ema=TRUE}.
This is the momentum to use when computing
the EMA of the model's weights:
\code{new_average = ema_momentum * old_average + (1 - ema_momentum) * current_variable_value}.}

\item{ema_overwrite_frequency}{Int or \code{NULL}, defaults to \code{NULL}. Only used if
\code{use_ema=TRUE}. Every \code{ema_overwrite_frequency} steps of iterations,
we overwrite the model variable by its moving average.
If \code{NULL}, the optimizer
does not overwrite model variables in the middle of training, and you
need to explicitly overwrite the variables at the end of training
by calling \code{optimizer$finalize_variable_values()}
(which updates the model
variables in-place). When using the built-in \code{fit()} training loop,
this happens automatically after the last epoch,
and you don't need to do anything.}

\item{name}{String. The name to use
for momentum accumulator weights created by
the optimizer.}

\item{...}{For forward/backward compatability.}

\item{loss_scale_factor}{Float or \code{NULL}. If a float, the scale factor will
be multiplied the loss before computing gradients, and the inverse of
the scale factor will be multiplied by the gradients before updating
variables. Useful for preventing underflow during mixed precision
training. Alternately, \code{\link[=optimizer_loss_scale]{optimizer_loss_scale()}} will
automatically set a loss scale factor.}

\item{gradient_accumulation_steps}{Int or \code{NULL}. If an int, model & optimizer
variables will not be updated at every step; instead they will be
updated every \code{gradient_accumulation_steps} steps, using the average
value of the gradients since the last update. This is known as
"gradient accumulation". This can be useful
when your batch size is very small, in order to reduce gradient
noise at each update step.}

\description{
The Lion optimizer is a stochastic-gradient-descent method that uses the
sign operator to control the magnitude of the update, unlike other adaptive
optimizers such as Adam that rely on second-order moments. This make
Lion more memory-efficient as it only keeps track of the momentum. According
to the authors (see reference), its performance gain over Adam grows with
the batch size. Because the update of Lion is produced through the sign
operation, resulting in a larger norm, a suitable learning rate for Lion is
typically 3-10x smaller than that for AdamW. The weight decay for Lion
should be in turn 3-10x larger than that for AdamW to maintain a
similar strength (lr * wd).
