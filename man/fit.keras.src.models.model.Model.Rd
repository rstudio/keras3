\arguments{
\item{object}{Keras model object}

\item{x}{Input data. It could be:
\itemize{
\item An array (or array-like), or a list of arrays
(in case the model has multiple inputs).
\item A tensor, or a list of tensors
(in case the model has multiple inputs).
\item A named list mapping input names to the corresponding array/tensors,
if the model has named inputs.
\item A \code{tf.data.Dataset}. Should return a tuple
of either \verb{(inputs, targets)} or
\verb{(inputs, targets, sample_weights)}.
\item A generator returning \verb{(inputs, targets)} or \verb{(inputs, targets, sample_weights)}.
}}

\item{y}{Target data. Like the input data \code{x},
it could be either array(s) or backend-native tensor(s).
If \code{x} is a TF Dataset or generator,
\code{y} should
not be specified (since targets will be obtained from \code{x}).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed on to the model \code{fit()} method.}

\item{batch_size}{Integer or \code{NULL}.
Number of samples per gradient update.
If unspecified, \code{batch_size} will default to \code{32}.
Do not specify the \code{batch_size} if your data is in the
form of TF Datasets or generators,
(since they generate batches).}

\item{epochs}{Integer. Number of epochs to train the model.
An epoch is an iteration over the entire \code{x} and \code{y}
data provided
(unless the \code{steps_per_epoch} flag is set to
something other than \code{NULL}).
Note that in conjunction with \code{initial_epoch},
\code{epochs} is to be understood as "final epoch".
The model is not trained for a number of iterations
given by \code{epochs}, but merely until the epoch
of index \code{epochs} is reached.}

\item{callbacks}{List of \code{Callback()} instances.
List of callbacks to apply during training.
See \verb{callback_*}.}

\item{validation_split}{Float between 0 and 1.
Fraction of the training data to be used as validation data.
The model will set apart this fraction of the training data,
will not train on it, and will evaluate
the loss and any model metrics
on this data at the end of each epoch.
The validation data is selected from the last samples
in the \code{x} and \code{y} data provided, before shuffling. This
argument is not supported when \code{x} is a TF Dataset or generator.
If both \code{validation_data} and \code{validation_split} are provided,
\code{validation_data} will override \code{validation_split}.}

\item{validation_data}{Data on which to evaluate
the loss and any model metrics at the end of each epoch.
The model will not be trained on this data. Thus, note the fact
that the validation loss of data provided using
\code{validation_split} or \code{validation_data} is not affected by
regularization layers like noise and dropout.
\code{validation_data} will override \code{validation_split}.
\code{validation_data} could be:
\itemize{
\item A tuple \verb{(x_val, y_val)} of arrays or tensors.
\item A tuple \verb{(x_val, y_val, val_sample_weights)} of
arrays.
\item A generator returning
\verb{(inputs, targets)} or \verb{(inputs, targets, sample_weights)}.
}}

\item{shuffle}{Boolean, whether to shuffle the training data
before each epoch. This argument is
ignored when \code{x} is a generator or a TF Dataset.}

\item{class_weight}{Optional named list mapping class indices (integers, 0-based)
to a weight (float) value, used for weighting the loss function
(during training only).
This can be useful to tell the model to
"pay more attention" to samples from
an under-represented class. When \code{class_weight} is specified
and targets have a rank of 2 or greater, either \code{y} must be
one-hot encoded, or an explicit final dimension of \code{1} must
be included for sparse class labels.}

\item{sample_weight}{Optional array of weights for
the training samples, used for weighting the loss function
(during training only). You can either pass a flat (1D)
array/vector with the same length as the input samples
(1:1 mapping between weights and samples),
or in the case of temporal data,
you can pass a 2D array (matrix) with shape
\verb{(samples, sequence_length)},
to apply a different weight to every timestep of every sample.
This argument is not supported when \code{x} is a TF Dataset or generator,
instead provide the
sample_weights as the third element of \code{x}.
Note that sample weighting does not apply to metrics specified
via the \code{metrics} argument in \code{compile()}. To apply sample
weighting to your metrics, you can specify them via the
\code{weighted_metrics} in \code{compile()} instead.}

\item{initial_epoch}{Integer.
Epoch at which to start training
(useful for resuming a previous training run).}

\item{steps_per_epoch}{Integer or \code{NULL}.
Total number of steps (batches of samples)
before declaring one epoch finished and starting the
next epoch. When training with input tensors such as
backend-native tensors, the default \code{NULL} is equal to
the number of samples in your dataset divided by
the batch size, or \code{1} if that cannot be determined. If \code{x} is a
TF Dataset, and \code{steps_per_epoch}
is \code{NULL}, the epoch will run until the input dataset is
exhausted.  When passing an infinitely repeating dataset, you
must specify the \code{steps_per_epoch} argument. If
\code{steps_per_epoch = -1} the training will run indefinitely with an
infinitely repeating dataset.}

\item{validation_steps}{Only relevant if \code{validation_data} is provided.
Total number of steps (batches of
samples) to draw before stopping when performing validation
at the end of every epoch. If \code{validation_steps} is \code{NULL},
validation will run until the \code{validation_data} dataset is
exhausted. In the case of an infinitely repeated dataset, it
will run into an infinite loop. If \code{validation_steps} is
specified and only part of the dataset will be consumed, the
evaluation will start from the beginning of the dataset at each
epoch. This ensures that the same validation samples are used
every time.}

\item{validation_batch_size}{Integer or \code{NULL}.
Number of samples per validation batch.
If unspecified, will default to \code{batch_size}.
Do not specify the \code{validation_batch_size} if your data is in
the form of TF Datasets or generator
instances (since they generate batches).}

\item{validation_freq}{Only relevant if validation data is provided.
Specifies how many training epochs to run
before a new validation run is performed, e.g. \code{validation_freq=2}
runs validation every 2 epochs.}

\item{verbose}{\code{"auto"}, \code{0}, \code{1}, or \code{2}. Verbosity mode.
\code{0} = silent, \code{1} = progress bar, \code{2} = one line per epoch.
\code{"auto"} becomes 1 for most cases,
\code{2} if in a knitr render or running on a distributed training server.
Note that the progress bar is not
particularly useful when logged to a file,
so \code{verbose=2} is recommended when not running interactively
(e.g., in a production environment). Defaults to \code{"auto"}.}

\item{view_metrics}{View realtime plot of training metrics (by epoch). The
default (\code{"auto"}) will display the plot when running within RStudio,
\code{metrics} were specified during model \code{\link[=compile]{compile()}}, \code{epochs > 1} and
\code{verbose > 0}. Set the global \code{options(keras.view_metrics = )} option to
establish a different default.}
}
\value{
A \code{History} object. Its \code{History.history} attribute is
a record of training loss values and metrics values
at successive epochs, as well as validation loss values
and validation metrics values (if applicable).

\description{
Train a model for a fixed number of epochs (dataset iterations).

\details{
Unpacking behavior for iterator-like inputs:

A common pattern is to pass an iterator like object such as a
\code{tf.data.Dataset} or a generator to \code{fit()},
which will in fact yield not only features (\code{x})
but optionally targets (\code{y}) and sample weights (\code{sample_weight}).
Keras requires that the output of such iterator-likes be
unambiguous. The iterator should return a \code{tuple()}
of length 1, 2, or 3, where the optional second and third elements
will be used for \code{y} and \code{sample_weight} respectively.
Any other type provided will be wrapped in
a length-one \code{tuple()}, effectively treating everything as \code{x}. When
yielding named lists, they should still adhere to the top-level tuple
structure,
e.g. \code{tuple(list(x0 = x0, x = x1), y)}. Keras will not attempt to separate
features, targets, and weights from the keys of a single dict.
