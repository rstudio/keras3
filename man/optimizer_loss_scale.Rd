\title{An optimizer that dynamically scales the loss to prevent underflow.}
\usage{
optimizer_loss_scale(
  inner_optimizer,

  dynamic_growth_steps = 2000L,
  ...,
  name = NULL,
  weight_decay = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{inner_optimizer}{The keras \code{Optimizer} instance to wrap.}

\item{initial_scale}{Float. The initial loss scale. This scale will be updated
during training. It is recommended for this to be a very high
number, because a loss scale that is too high gets lowered far more
quickly than a loss scale that is too low gets raised.}

\item{dynamic_growth_steps}{Int. How often to update the scale upwards. After
every \code{dynamic_growth_steps} steps with finite gradients, the
loss scale is doubled.}

\item{...}{For forward/backward compatability.}

\item{name}{String. The name to use
for momentum accumulator weights created by
the optimizer.}

\item{weight_decay}{Float. If set, weight decay is applied.}

\item{clipnorm}{Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is individually
clipped so that its norm is no higher than this value.}

\item{clipvalue}{Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is clipped to be
no higher than this value.}

\item{global_clipnorm}{Float. If set, the gradient of all weights is clipped
so that their global norm is no higher than this value.}

\item{use_ema}{Boolean, defaults to \code{FALSE}.
If \code{TRUE}, exponential moving average
(EMA) is applied. EMA consists of computing an exponential moving
average of the weights of the model (as the weight values change after
each training batch), and periodically overwriting the weights with
their moving average.}

\item{ema_momentum}{Float, defaults to 0.99. Only used if \code{use_ema=TRUE}.
This is the momentum to use when computing
the EMA of the model's weights:
\code{new_average = ema_momentum * old_average + (1 - ema_momentum) * current_variable_value}.}

\item{ema_overwrite_frequency}{Int or \code{NULL}, defaults to \code{NULL}. Only used if
\code{use_ema=TRUE}. Every \code{ema_overwrite_frequency} steps of iterations,
we overwrite the model variable by its moving average.
If \code{NULL}, the optimizer
does not overwrite model variables in the middle of training, and you
need to explicitly overwrite the variables at the end of training
by calling \code{optimizer$finalize_variable_values()}
(which updates the model
variables in-place). When using the built-in \code{fit()} training loop,
this happens automatically after the last epoch,
and you don't need to do anything.}

\item{loss_scale_factor}{Float or \code{NULL}. If a float, the scale factor will
be multiplied the loss before computing gradients, and the inverse of
the scale factor will be multiplied by the gradients before updating
variables. Useful for preventing underflow during mixed precision
training. Alternately, \code{\link[=optimizer_loss_scale]{optimizer_loss_scale()}} will
automatically set a loss scale factor.}

\item{gradient_accumulation_steps}{Int or \code{NULL}. If an int, model and optimizer
variables will not be updated at every step; instead they will be
updated every \code{gradient_accumulation_steps} steps, using the average
value of the gradients since the last update. This is known as
"gradient accumulation". This can be useful
when your batch size is very small, in order to reduce gradient
noise at each update step. EMA frequency will look at "accumulated"
iterations value (optimizer steps // gradient_accumulation_steps).
Learning rate schedules will look at "real" iterations value
(optimizer steps).}

\description{
Loss scaling is a technique to prevent numeric underflow in intermediate
gradients when float16 is used. To prevent underflow, the loss is multiplied
(or "scaled") by a certain factor called the "loss scale", which causes
intermediate gradients to be scaled by the loss scale as well. The final
gradients are divided (or "unscaled") by the loss scale to bring them back
to their original value.

\code{LossScaleOptimizer} wraps another optimizer and applies dynamic loss
scaling to it. This loss scale is dynamically updated over time as follows:
\itemize{
\item On any train step, if a nonfinite gradient is encountered, the loss scale
is halved, and the train step is skipped.
\item If \code{dynamic_growth_steps} have ocurred since the last time the loss scale
was updated, and no nonfinite gradients have occurred, the loss scale
is doubled.
