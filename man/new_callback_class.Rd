\arguments{
\item{classname}{The name of the callback class. CamelCase by convention.}

\item{on_epoch_begin}{\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{\\(epoch, logs = NULL)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Called at the start of an epoch.

Subclasses should override for any actions to run. This function should
only be called during TRAIN mode.

Args:
\itemize{
\item \code{epoch}: Integer, index of epoch.
\item \code{logs}: Named List. Currently no data is passed to this argument for this
method but that may change in the future.
}}

}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Called at the end of an epoch.

Subclasses should override for any actions to run. This function should
only be called during TRAIN mode.

Args:
\itemize{
\item \code{epoch}: Integer, index of epoch.
\item \code{logs}: Named List, metric results for this training epoch, and for the
validation epoch if validation is performed. Validation result
keys are prefixed with \code{val_}. For training epoch, the values of
the \code{Model}'s metrics are returned. Example:
\code{list(loss = 0.2, accuracy = 0.7)}.
}}

\item{on_train_begin}{\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{\\(logs = NULL)

Args:
\itemize{

\code{N} batches.

Args:
\itemize{
\item \code{batch}: Integer, index of batch within the current epoch.

\code{N} batches.

Args:
\itemize{
\item \code{batch}: Integer, index of batch within the current epoch.
\item \code{logs}: Named list. Aggregated metric results up until this batch.

Called at the end of evaluation or validation.

Subclasses should override for any actions to run.

Args:
\itemize{
\item \code{logs}: Named list. Currently the output of the last call to
\code{on_test_batch_end()} is passed to this argument for this method
but that may change in the future.

\item{..., public}{Additional methods or public members of the custom class.}

\item{private}{Named list of R objects (typically, functions) to include in
instance private environments. \code{private} will be a symbol in scope in all
class methods, resolving to an R environment populated with the list
provided. Each instance will have it's own \code{private} environment. All
methods (functions) in \code{private} will have in scope \code{self} and \verb{__class__}
symbols. Any objects in \code{private} will be invisible from the Keras
framework and the Python runtime.}

\item{inherit}{The Callback class to inherit from. By default, the base \code{Callback}.}

\item{parent_env}{The environment that all class methods will have as a grandparent.}
