\title{keras3: R Interface to 'Keras'}
\description{
Interface to 'Keras' \url{https://keras.io}, a high-level neural networks 'API'. 'Keras' was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation, supports both convolution based networks and recurrent networks (as well as combinations of the two), and runs seamlessly on both 'CPU' and 'GPU' devices.

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, developed with a focus on enabling
fast experimentation. Keras has the following key features:
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Allows the same code to run on CPU or on GPU, seamlessly.
\item User-friendly API which makes it easy to quickly prototype deep learning models.
\item Built-in support for convolutional networks (for computer vision), recurrent
networks (for sequence processing), and any combination of both.
\item Supports arbitrary network architectures: multi-input or multi-output models,
layer sharing, model sharing, etc. This means that Keras is appropriate for
building essentially any deep learning model, from a memory network to a neural
Turing machine.
\item Is capable of running on top of multiple back-ends including
\href{https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow}{TensorFlow},
\href{https://github.com/google/jax}{Jax},
or \href{https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch}{PyTorch}.
}
