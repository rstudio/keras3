\arguments{
\item{learning_rate}{A float, a
\code{\link[=LearningRateSchedule]{LearningRateSchedule()}} instance, or
a callable that takes no arguments and returns the actual value to
use. The learning rate. Defaults to \code{0.001}.}

\item{learning_rate_power}{A float value, must be less or equal to zero.
Controls how the learning rate decreases during training. Use zero
for a fixed learning rate.}

\item{initial_accumulator_value}{The starting value for accumulators. Only
zero or positive values are allowed.}

\item{l1_regularization_strength}{A float value, must be greater than or equal
to zero. Defaults to \code{0.0}.}

\item{l2_regularization_strength}{A float value, must be greater than or equal
to zero. Defaults to \code{0.0}.}

\item{l2_shrinkage_regularization_strength}{A float value, must be greater
than or equal to zero. This differs from L2 above in that the L2
above is a stabilization penalty, whereas this L2 shrinkage is a
magnitude penalty. When input is sparse shrinkage will only happen
on the active weights.}

\item{beta}{A float value, representing the beta value from the paper.
Defaults to \code{0.0}.}

\item{weight_decay}{Float. If set, weight decay is applied.}

\item{clipnorm}{Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is individually
clipped so that its norm is no higher than this value.}

\item{clipvalue}{Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is clipped to be
no higher than this value.}

\item{global_clipnorm}{Float. If set, the gradient of all weights is clipped
so that their global norm is no higher than this value.}

\item{use_ema}{Boolean, defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, exponential moving average
(EMA) is applied. EMA consists of computing an exponential moving
average of the weights of the model (as the weight values change after
each training batch), and periodically overwriting the weights with
their moving average.}

\item{ema_momentum}{Float, defaults to 0.99. Only used if \code{use_ema=TRUE}.
This is the momentum to use when computing
the EMA of the model's weights:
\code{new_average = ema_momentum * old_average + (1 - ema_momentum) * current_variable_value}.}

\item{ema_overwrite_frequency}{Int or NULL, defaults to NULL. Only used if
\code{use_ema=TRUE}. Every \code{ema_overwrite_frequency} steps of iterations,
we overwrite the model variable by its moving average.
If NULL, the optimizer
does not overwrite model variables in the middle of training, and you
need to explicitly overwrite the variables at the end of training
by calling \code{optimizer$finalize_variable_values()}
(which updates the model
variables in-place). When using the built-in \code{fit()} training loop,
this happens automatically after the last epoch,
and you don't need to do anything.}

\item{name}{String. The name to use
for momentum accumulator weights created by
the optimizer.}

\item{...}{For forward/backward compatability.}

\item{loss_scale_factor}{Float or \code{NULL}. If a float, the scale factor will
be multiplied the loss before computing gradients, and the inverse of
the scale factor will be multiplied by the gradients before updating
variables. Useful for preventing underflow during mixed precision
training. Alternately, \code{optimizer_loss_scale} will
automatically set a loss scale factor.}

\item{gradient_accumulation_steps}{Int or \code{NULL}. If an int, model & optimizer
variables will not be updated at every step; instead they will be
updated every \code{gradient_accumulation_steps} steps, using the average
value of the gradients since the last update. This is known as
"gradient accumulation". This can be useful
when your batch size is very small, in order to reduce gradient
noise at each update step.}

\description{
"Follow The Regularized Leader" (FTRL) is an optimization algorithm
developed at Google for click-through rate prediction in the early 2010s. It
is most suitable for shallow models with large and sparse feature spaces.
The algorithm is described by
\href{https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/41159.pdf}{McMahan et al., 2013}.
The Keras version has support for both online L2 regularization
(the L2 regularization described in the paper
above) and shrinkage-type L2 regularization
(which is the addition of an L2 penalty to the loss function).

Initialization:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{n <- 0
sigma <- 0
z <- 0
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Update rule for one variable \code{w}:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{prev_n <- n
n <- n + g^2
sigma <- (n^(-lr_power) - prev_n^(-lr_power)) / lr
z <- z + g - sigma * w
if (abs(z) < lambda_1) \{
  w <- 0
\} else \{
  w <- (sgn(z) * lambda_1 - z) / ((beta + sqrt(n)) / alpha + lambda_2)
\}
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Notation:
\itemize{
\item \code{lr} is the learning rate
\item \code{g} is the gradient for the variable
\item \code{lambda_1} is the L1 regularization strength
\item \code{lambda_2} is the L2 regularization strength
\item \code{lr_power} is the power to scale n.
}

Check the documentation for the \code{l2_shrinkage_regularization_strength}
parameter for more details when shrinkage is enabled, in which case gradient
is replaced with a gradient with shrinkage.
