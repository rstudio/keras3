\usage{
application_efficientnet_v2m(
include_top = TRUE,
weights = "imagenet",
input_tensor = NULL,
input_shape = NULL,
pooling = NULL,
classes = 1000L,
classifier_activation = "softmax",
include_preprocessing = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{include_top}{Boolean, whether to include the fully-connected
layer at the top of the network. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{weights}{One of \code{NULL} (random initialization),
\code{"imagenet"} (pre-training on ImageNet),
or the path to the weights file to be loaded. Defaults to \code{"imagenet"}.}

\item{input_tensor}{Optional Keras tensor
(i.e. output of \code{layers.Input()})
to use as image input for the model.}

\item{input_shape}{Optional shape tuple, only to be specified
if \code{include_top} is \code{FALSE}.
It should have exactly 3 inputs channels.}

\item{pooling}{Optional pooling mode for feature extraction
when \code{include_top} is \code{FALSE}. Defaults to \code{NULL}.
\itemize{
\item \code{NULL} means that the output of the model will be
the 4D tensor output of the
last convolutional layer.
\item \code{"avg"} means that global average pooling
will be applied to the output of the
last convolutional layer, and thus
the output of the model will be a 2D tensor.
\item \code{"max"} means that global max pooling will
be applied.
}}

\item{classes}{Optional number of classes to classify images
into, only to be specified if \code{include_top} is \code{TRUE}, and
if no \code{weights} argument is specified. Defaults to 1000 (number of
ImageNet classes).}

\item{classifier_activation}{A string or callable. The activation function to use
on the "top" layer. Ignored unless \code{include_top=TRUE}. Set
\code{classifier_activation=NULL} to return the logits of the "top" layer.
Defaults to \code{"softmax"}.
When loading pretrained weights, \code{classifier_activation} can only
be \code{NULL} or \code{"softmax"}.}

\item{include_preprocessing}{Boolean, whether to include the preprocessing layer at the bottom of the network.}
}
\value{
A model instance.

This function returns a Keras image classification model,
optionally loaded with weights pre-trained on ImageNet.

For image classification use cases, see
\href{https://keras.io/api/applications/#usage-examples-for-image-classification-models}{this page for detailed examples}.

For transfer learning use cases, make sure to read the
\href{https://keras.io/guides/transfer_learning/}{guide to transfer learning & fine-tuning}.

\section{Note}{
Each Keras Application expects a specific kind of input preprocessing.
For EfficientNetV2, by default input preprocessing is included as a part of
the model (as a \code{Rescaling} layer), and thus
\code{\link[=application_preprocess_inputs]{application_preprocess_inputs()}} is actually a
pass-through function. In this use case, EfficientNetV2 models expect their
inputs to be float tensors of pixels with values in the \verb{[0, 255]} range.
At the same time, preprocessing as a part of the model (i.e. \code{Rescaling}
layer) can be disabled by setting \code{include_preprocessing} argument to \code{FALSE}.
With preprocessing disabled EfficientNetV2 models expect their inputs to be
float tensors of pixels with values in the \verb{[-1, 1]} range.
