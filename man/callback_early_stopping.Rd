\title{Stop training when a monitored metric has stopped improving.}
\usage{
callback_early_stopping(
  monitor = "val_loss",
  min_delta = 0L,
  patience = 0L,
  verbose = 0L,
  mode = "auto",
  baseline = NULL,
  restore_best_weights = FALSE,
  start_from_epoch = 0L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{monitor}{Quantity to be monitored. Defaults to \code{"val_loss"}.}

\item{min_delta}{Minimum change in the monitored quantity to qualify as an
improvement, i.e. an absolute change of less than min_delta, will
count as no improvement. Defaults to \code{0}.}

\item{patience}{Number of epochs with no improvement after which training will
be stopped. Defaults to \code{0}.}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity mode, 0 or 1. Mode 0 is silent, and mode 1 displays
messages when the callback takes an action. Defaults to \code{0}.}

\item{mode}{One of \verb{\{"auto", "min", "max"\}}. In \code{min} mode, training will stop
when the quantity monitored has stopped decreasing; in \code{"max"} mode
it will stop when the quantity monitored has stopped increasing; in
\code{"auto"} mode, the direction is automatically inferred from the name
of the monitored quantity. Defaults to \code{"auto"}.}

\item{baseline}{Baseline value for the monitored quantity. If not \code{NULL},
training will stop if the model doesn't show improvement over the
baseline. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{restore_best_weights}{Whether to restore model weights from the epoch
with the best value of the monitored quantity. If \code{FALSE}, the model
weights obtained at the last step of training are used. An epoch
will be restored regardless of the performance relative to the
\code{baseline}. If no epoch improves on \code{baseline}, training will run
for \code{patience} epochs and restore weights from the best epoch in
that set. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{start_from_epoch}{Number of epochs to wait before starting to monitor
improvement. This allows for a warm-up period in which no
improvement is expected and thus training will not be stopped.
Defaults to \code{0}.}
}
\description{
Assuming the goal of a training is to minimize the loss. With this, the
metric to be monitored would be \code{'loss'}, and mode would be \code{'min'}. A
\code{model$fit()} training loop will check at end of every epoch whether
the loss is no longer decreasing, considering the \code{min_delta} and
\code{patience} if applicable. Once it's found no longer decreasing,
\code{model$stop_training} is marked \code{TRUE} and the training terminates.

The quantity to be monitored needs to be available in \code{logs} list.
To make it so, pass the loss or metrics at \code{model$compile()}.
