\item{initialize, call, build, get_config}{Recommended methods to implement. See
description and details sections.}

\item{..., public}{Additional methods or public members of the custom class.}

\item{private}{Named list of R objects (typically, functions) to include in
instance private environments. \code{private} methods will have all the same
symbols in scope as public methods (See section "Symbols in Scope"). Each
instance will have it's own \code{private} environment. Any objects
in \code{private} will be invisible from the Keras framework and the Python
runtime.}

\item{inherit}{What the custom class will subclass. By default, the base keras class.}

\item{parent_env}{The R environment that all class methods will have as a grandparent.}
