\alias{k_logsumexp}
\title{(Deprecated) Computes log(sum(exp(elements across dimensions of a tensor))).}
\usage{
k_logsumexp(x, axis = NULL, keepdims = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A tensor or variable.}

\item{axis}{An integer, the axis to reduce over (axis indexes are 1-based).}

\item{keepdims}{A boolean, whether to keep the dimensions or not. If
\code{keepdims} is \code{FALSE}, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1. If
\code{keepdims} is \code{TRUE}, the reduced dimension is retained with length 1.}
}
\value{
The reduced tensor.
}
\description{
This funciton is deprecated. Please use \code{tensorflow::tf$reduce_logsumexp()}.
}
\details{
This function is more numerically stable than log(sum(exp(x))). It avoids
overflows caused by taking the exp of large inputs and underflows caused by
taking the log of small inputs.

\section{Keras Backend}{


This function is part of a set of Keras backend functions that enable
lower level access to the core operations of the backend tensor engine
(e.g. TensorFlow, CNTK, Theano, etc.).
