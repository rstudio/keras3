\arguments{
\item{learning_rate}{A float, a
\code{\link[=LearningRateSchedule]{LearningRateSchedule()}} instance, or
a callable that takes no arguments and returns the actual value to
use. The learning rate. Defaults to \code{0.001}.}

\item{beta_1}{A float value or a constant float tensor. The exponential decay
rate for the 1st moment estimates.}

\item{beta_2}{A float value or a constant float tensor. The exponential decay
rate for the exponentially weighted infinity norm.}

\item{epsilon}{A small constant for numerical stability.
name: String. The name to use
for momentum accumulator weights created by
the optimizer.}

\item{weight_decay}{Float. If set, weight decay is applied.}

\item{clipnorm}{Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is individually
clipped so that its norm is no higher than this value.}

\item{clipvalue}{Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is clipped to be
no higher than this value.}

\item{global_clipnorm}{Float. If set, the gradient of all weights is clipped
so that their global norm is no higher than this value.}

\item{use_ema}{Boolean, defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, exponential moving average
(EMA) is applied. EMA consists of computing an exponential moving
average of the weights of the model (as the weight values change after
each training batch), and periodically overwriting the weights with
their moving average.}

\item{ema_momentum}{Float, defaults to 0.99. Only used if \code{use_ema=TRUE}.
This is the momentum to use when computing
the EMA of the model's weights:
\code{new_average = ema_momentum * old_average + (1 - ema_momentum) * current_variable_value}.}

\item{ema_overwrite_frequency}{Int or NULL, defaults to NULL. Only used if
\code{use_ema=TRUE}. Every \code{ema_overwrite_frequency} steps of iterations,
we overwrite the model variable by its moving average.
If NULL, the optimizer
does not overwrite model variables in the middle of training, and you
need to explicitly overwrite the variables at the end of training
by calling \code{optimizer$finalize_variable_values()}
(which updates the model
variables in-place). When using the built-in \code{fit()} training loop,
this happens automatically after the last epoch,
and you don't need to do anything.}

\item{name}{String, name for the object}

\item{...}{For forward/backward compatability.}

\item{loss_scale_factor}{Float or \code{NULL}. If a float, the scale factor will
be multiplied the loss before computing gradients, and the inverse of
the scale factor will be multiplied by the gradients before updating
variables. Useful for preventing underflow during mixed precision
training. Alternately, \code{\link[=optimizer_loss_scale]{optimizer_loss_scale()}} will
automatically set a loss scale factor.}

\item{gradient_accumulation_steps}{Int or \code{NULL}. If an int, model & optimizer
variables will not be updated at every step; instead they will be
updated every \code{gradient_accumulation_steps} steps, using the average
value of the gradients since the last update. This is known as
"gradient accumulation". This can be useful
when your batch size is very small, in order to reduce gradient
noise at each update step.}

\description{
Adamax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm, is a first-order
gradient-based optimization method. Due to its capability of adjusting the
learning rate based on data characteristics, it is suited to learn
time-variant process, e.g., speech data with dynamically changed noise
conditions. Default parameters follow those provided in the paper (see
references below).

Initialization:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{m <- 0  # Initialize initial 1st moment vector
u <- 0  # Initialize the exponentially weighted infinity norm
t <- 0  # Initialize timestep
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

The update rule for parameter \code{w} with gradient \code{g} is described at the end
of section 7.1 of the paper (see the referenece section):

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{t <-  t + 1
m <- beta1 * m + (1 - beta) * g
u <- max(beta2 * u, abs(g))
current_lr <- learning_rate / (1 - beta1 ** t)
w <- w - current_lr * m / (u + epsilon)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
