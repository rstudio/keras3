\title{Apply multiplicative 1-centered Gaussian noise.}
\usage{
layer_gaussian_dropout(
  object,
  rate,
  input_shape = NULL,
  batch_input_shape = NULL,
  batch_size = NULL,
  dtype = NULL,
  name = NULL,
  trainable = NULL,
  weights = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Model or layer object}

\item{rate}{float, drop probability (as with \code{Dropout}). The multiplicative
noise will have standard deviation \code{sqrt(rate / (1 - rate))}.}

\item{input_shape}{Dimensionality of the input (integer) not including the
samples axis. This argument is required when using this layer as the first
layer in a model.}

\item{batch_input_shape}{Shapes, including the batch size. For instance,
\code{batch_input_shape=c(10, 32)} indicates that the expected input will be
batches of 10 32-dimensional vectors. \code{batch_input_shape=list(NULL, 32)}
indicates batches of an arbitrary number of 32-dimensional vectors.}

\item{batch_size}{Fixed batch size for layer}

\item{dtype}{The data type expected by the input, as a string (\code{float32},
\code{float64}, \code{int32}...)}

\item{name}{An optional name string for the layer. Should be unique in a
model (do not reuse the same name twice). It will be autogenerated if it
isn't provided.}

\item{trainable}{Whether the layer weights will be updated during training.}

\item{weights}{Initial weights for layer.}
}
\description{
As it is a regularization layer, it is only active at training time.
}
\section{Input shape}{
 Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument \code{input_shape} (list
of integers, does not include the samples axis) when using this layer as
the first layer in a model.
}

\section{Output shape}{
 Same shape as input.
