Subclasses should override for any actions to run. This function should
only be called during TRAIN mode.

\item{..., public}{Additional methods or public members of the custom class.}

\item{private}{Named list of R objects (typically, functions) to include in
instance private environments. \code{private} methods will have all the same
symbols in scope as public methods (See section "Symbols in Scope"). Each
instance will have it's own \code{private} environment. Any objects
in \code{private} will be invisible from the Keras framework and the Python
runtime.}

\item{inherit}{What the custom class will subclass. By default, the base keras class.}

\item{parent_env}{The R environment that all class methods will have as a grandparent.}
}
\description{
Callbacks can be passed to keras methods such as \code{fit()}, \code{evaluate()}, and
\code{predict()} in order to hook into the various stages of the model training,
evaluation, and inference lifecycle.

To create a custom callback, call \code{Callback()} and
override the method associated with the stage of interest.

All R function custom methods (public and private) will have the
following symbols in scope:
\itemize{
\item \code{self}: the \code{Layer} instance.
\item \code{super}: the \code{Layer} superclass.
\item \code{private}: An R environment specific to the class instance.
Any objects defined here will be invisible to the Keras framework.
\item \verb{__class__} the current class type object. This will also be available as
an alias symbol, the value supplied to \code{Layer(classname = )}
}
}

\section{Attributes (accessible via \verb{self$})}{
\itemize{
\item \code{params}: Named list, Training parameters
(e.g. verbosity, batch size, number of epochs, ...).
\item \code{model}: Instance of \code{Model}.
Reference of the model being trained.
}

The \code{logs} named list that callback methods
take as argument will contain keys for quantities relevant to
the current batch or epoch (see method-specific docstrings).

\section{Symbols in scope}{
