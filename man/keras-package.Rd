\title{R interface to Keras}
\description{
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, developed with a focus on enabling
fast experimentation. Keras has the following key features:
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Allows the same code to run on CPU or on GPU, seamlessly.
\item User-friendly API which makes it easy to quickly prototype deep learning models.
\item Built-in support for convolutional networks (for computer vision), recurrent
networks (for sequence processing), and any combination of both.
\item Supports arbitrary network architectures: multi-input or multi-output models,
layer sharing, model sharing, etc. This means that Keras is appropriate for
building essentially any deep learning model, from a memory network to a neural
Turing machine.
\item Is capable of running on top of multiple back-ends including

or \href{https://github.com/Theano/Theano}{Theano}.
