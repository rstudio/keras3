Constrains the weights incident to each hidden unit to have unit norm.

@param axis
integer, axis along which to calculate weight norms.
For instance, in a `Dense` layer the weight matrix
has shape `(input_dim, output_dim)`,
set `axis` to `0` to constrain each weight vector
of length `(input_dim,)`.
In a `Conv2D` layer with `data_format = "channels_last"`,
the weight tensor has shape
`(rows, cols, input_depth, output_depth)`,
set `axis` to `[0, 1, 2]`
to constrain the weights of each filter tensor of size
`(rows, cols, input_depth)`.
