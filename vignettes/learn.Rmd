There are 5 tutorials covering [Basic Classification](tutorial_basic_classfication.html), [Text Classification](tutorial_basic_text_classification.html), [Basic Regression](tutorial_basic_regression.html), [Overfitting and Underfitting](tutorial_overfit_underfit.html), and how to [Save and Restore Models](tutorial_save_and_restore.html). |

The goal of the book is to provide a learning resource for the R community that goes all the way from basic theory to advanced practical applications. You’ll learn from more than 30 code examples that include detailed commentary and practical recommendations. You don’t need previous experience with machine learning or deep learning: this book covers from scratch all the necessary basics. You don’t need an advanced mathematics background, either---high-school-level mathematics should suffice in order to follow along. |
| <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618"><img class="nav-image illustration" src="images/resources-deep-learning.jpg" width=250/></a>  | [**Deep Learning**](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618) <br/>An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology. This is the definitive textbook on deep learning. Written by major contributors to the field, it is clear, comprehensive, and authoritative. If you want to know where deep learning came from, what it is good for, and where it is going, read this book.|
